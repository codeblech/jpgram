# JPgram

You ever feel like there’s just no centralized college mag out there? Yeah, me too. So I made **jpgram**, a self-updating magazine scraping posts from all those random college club/society Instagram pages. It grabs the juicy metadata too – dates, captions, the whole shebang.

It’s like your college clubs’ Instagrams had a baby with a blog, but with way more flair and less "we forgot to update our website for 6 months" vibes.

## But why tho?

Well, 'cause nobody else is doing it. College clubs have their own websites, sure, but this is like… the **one ring to rule them all**. A single source of truth, if you will. Plus, writers from the PageTurnerSociety? I see you. You’re cooking up some good stuff. Let this be your platform.

## So, how does it work?

It's simple: **web scraping**. The backend pulls in posts from IG pages, stores them all neat and tidy, and displays them in one spot for your viewing pleasure. Think of it like an auto-updating college mag. You can check out the latest posts, the coolest events, or just see what nonsense clubs are up to, all in one place.

## What’s next?

Listen, the self-updating part? That’s sick. But clubs and societies should have their own **human-maintained sections** on here. That’s the vision. Sure, they have their own websites, but this is a unified hub where everything comes together. Writers? y’all deserve a space to flex. Post your poetry, hot takes, or whatever else makes you tick.

## Contributions? Yeah, we need those.

- **Frontend**: Somebody, please, just do it. I’m begging.
- **Consistency**: It’d be real nice if all the clubs contributed posts regularly.

Go give it a peek. Or don’t. But like… do.
