NSS JIIT solemnly pledge to uphold traffic rules for the safety of all road users. 
NSS JIIT will obey speed limits, avoid reckless driving, and never drive under the influence. Seat belts will always be worn, and distractions like phone usage will be avoided.
We promise to respect pedestrians and cyclists, giving them the right of way.
 Let us collectively work towards creating a safer road environment for everyone âœ¨
Safety first, always!
