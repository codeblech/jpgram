NSS the social hub of JIIT is going to provide an opportunity to  everyone feel how  females feel when they are on their periods and for this we have the module " no - menstruators , let's talk about periods." 

By doing so we promote some of the aspects like environment and health , livelihood , education and de-stigmatization .

So we the social hub invite you all to feel the ' Oh cramps ' thing in the annual techno-cultural fest of JIIT . 

Please mark your calendars for the event at 18th March , 2023 from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at Atrium ABB1 (between LT2 & LT3).
