Vijayadashami (Dussehra), is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It falls just after the nine days of navratri. It marks the victory of good over evil. It is a time for joy, family gatherings, decorations, and the exchange of gifts and sweets. Dussehra holds cultural and religious significance in India and is a time for communities to come together in celebration.
"On this Dussehra, let's celebrate the courage to stand up for what is right, the strength to face our inner demons, and the wisdom to choose the path of righteousness. May victory be yours in every endeavor."

NSS JIIT wishes you all a very "HAPPY DUSSEHRA" ðŸ’«âœ¨
