We are heading to Arthala village with our amazing team of volunteers, faculty coordinators, and student council members for a meaningful endeavor. 🙌

🧹 We're all set to roll up our sleeves and kick off a Cleanliness Drive at Kailashvati Inter College School. ♻️ Let's join hands to keep our surroundings clean and green! 🌿

But wait, there's more! 🎨 Alongside the Cleanliness Drive, our dedicated NSS volunteers will also be spreading some love through a Whitewash session at the school. 🖌️ Let's brighten up the learning environment and create a space that inspires growth and learning. 📚
