Only a doctor is blessed with the magical powers to treat a life, to bring health into our lives and to be there with us when we have lost all the hopes. This is to all the doctors who always put their patients first and do their best to gift health to their patients.
 Wishing a very Happy Doctors Day ! Thank You for your service towards humanity! All the volunteers of JIIT NSS-62 salute you!
