Your chance to eradicate blood shortage
Human blood is an essential element of human life with no substitute. In many major surgeries and trauma emergencies the use of whole blood is now well accepted. Blood transfusion has been responsible for saving millions of lives each year around the world. Yet the quantity and quality of blood pool available for transfusion is still a major concern across the globe, especially in the developing countries.

Why you should donate blood?
• This lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation. The need for blood is constant. 
• Blood brings oxygen and nutrients to all the parts of the body so they can keep working.
👉🏼 It cannot be manufactured: donors are the only source.
👉🏼 It is harmless to the donor itself.
Blood shortage is a nation-wide problem and we all have seen it.

  Youth holds the key
👉🏼 They should know how important it is to donate blood and how they can help 3-4 people by donating the blood once.
👉🏼 It can reduce by 6-7% every year and the deaths caused by blood loss can also be reduced by 2-3%, if 18 years and above college students starts donating blood.

All the donors would be given certificates as well  as refreshments.

Looking forward to having a great camp with you!
