Prevention and readiness are more important than ever for every woman today. Knowing how to defend yourself and your loved ones in the event of a potentially violent confrontation can save lives. 

We are pleased to announce that on March 8, 2022, we will host a Self Defense Workshop for women with the goal of increasing confidence through self-defense awareness. We urge you to gain mental, physical, and emotional empowerment by learning the most proven and effective self-defense skills in a safe atmosphere. The workshop's focus will be on learning the best strategies to identify and respond to dangerous circumstances, strike and take down the attacker, and protect by quickly managing and escaping from the adversary. 
All women are welcome to attend this workshop, which is free of charge.
