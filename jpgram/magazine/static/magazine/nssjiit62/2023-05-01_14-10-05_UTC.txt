Exciting news! 
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) hosted a book fair at our college for 2 days . They helped us to explore a vast collection of books on spirituality and self-discovery.
They gave us the opportunity to expand our knowledge and consciousness. Glad to have them.
