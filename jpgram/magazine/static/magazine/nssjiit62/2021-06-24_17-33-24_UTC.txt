Yoga teaches us to cure what need not be endured and endure what cannot be cured.
NSS in collaboration with yoga and health club invites  you all to attend a fun-filled Yoga day event.  The yoga instructor will basically focus on neck and spine because these days are really tough for each and every one of us,  from Teachers to students to parents to everyone out there. We sit in front of our phone and laptop for hours which in return give us only and only stress and pain.

Saturday, June 26
5:30 â€“ 6:30pm
