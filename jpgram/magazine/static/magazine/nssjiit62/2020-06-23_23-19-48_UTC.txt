I joined NSS in my 1st year when it was still in its initial days under the able guidence of Santoshi ma'am and Dr.Swati. But what I started as a mere time pass became a source of immense pleasure giving me self-satisfaction like I had never experienced before. Our visits to the Sewa group where we would go and spend our time with those wonderful, talented kids who in there very innocence taught us what a fortunate life we are leading.Teaching them a productive skill,providing them digital literacy were some of the work we did there.Then from Sewa group to Grace Home NSS did not stop,we widened our affiliations to such organisations as more and more students joined this initiative. Personally NSS has had a huge impact on me. I consider joining NSS one of my best decisions ever.
