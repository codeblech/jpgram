"It is necessary to process your photos. It's simply a question as to whether you do it, or the camera does it."
 Photoshop can be a way of getting a second chance to get the image the way you would have wanted to capture it in camera.
You can make any event look and feel more vibrant,  fun and appealing with photo editing.
