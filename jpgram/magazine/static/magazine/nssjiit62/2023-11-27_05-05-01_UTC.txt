“Even Kings and emperors with heaps of wealth and vast dominion cannot compare with an ant filled with the love of God.”
― Guru Nanak, Sri Guru Granth Sahib
Guru Nanak Jayanti is a significant and joyous Sikh festival that commemorates the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism and the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. This auspicious occasion typically falls on the full moon day in the month of Kartik, according to the Nanakshahi calendar. The day is a celebration of Guru Nanak Dev Ji's life, his teachings and an opportunity for followers to reflect on his profound philosophy of unity, equality, and selfless service.
On this auspicious occasion, NSS JIIT extends its heartfelt wishes to you and your loved ones. May this day bring joy, peace, and spiritual enlightenment into your life.✨✨
