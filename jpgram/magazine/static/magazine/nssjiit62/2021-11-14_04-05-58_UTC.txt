A child can always teach an adult three things:
ðŸŒŸto be happy for no reason, 
ðŸŒŸto always be busy with something, 
ðŸŒŸand to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.
Remember when we were little, we always wanted to grow up. Now we realize it was better being a kid! Wishing that little children inside us a very Happy Childrenâ€™s Day.
