My journey as a member of NSS has been the most beautiful one. I don't know how to put it in words, the entire time spent with these kids in Seva India and grace homes, it was so inspiring that I still wish to go and meet them every weekend, share happiness, dance and sing along with them. No matter with what kind of mood I used to leave from college, while returning back there was always a smile and satisfaction drawn from those moments of happiness spent with these kids.

In our college NSS was established in the year when I was a fresher. As the motto says, "Not me, but you!", from the time of joining, I have devoted most of my time to this organisation and It feels really great to be amongst such people who have worked really hard in establishing and promoting this scheme. This team has never been less than a family to me and we're still working together for improverising it. Though our tenure as a member is about to end soon even then we will make sure to be active participants wherever possible.
