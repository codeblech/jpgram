"Rakhi is the thread that binds two souls in a bond of joy forever."🩵
Raksha Bandhan, as perceived by the members of the NSS, isn't just about the bond between siblings; it's a reflection of mutual trust we share within our community. Each rakhi tied symbolizes the promise we make in NSS – to serve, to protect, and to foster unity.🍀
As we tie the Rakhi, let's also remember our promise to uplift, support, and grow together, building a more cohesive and compassionate world.❤️
