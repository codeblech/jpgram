Service has always been my peace
And NSS is a very important piece
A piece that if you rip apart
I'll trip hard
For NSS, gave me a mirror 
To know who I really am
NSS, gave me friends cheerer
To believe in who I am
NSS, gave me opportunity to serve
To believe in what I deserve
To be a little more happier
For whenever I saw people happier 
I was welcomed with beautiful little smiles 
That make you forget all the hard times
They danced hard and sang endlessly 
And I sat their like fallen in ecstasy seamlessly
For my stressing had finally found a happy place 
It was finally calm and didn't race
NSS is my happy place something that I take pride in
A place I was really identified in
