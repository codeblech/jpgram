Service before self...that's how the adage goes.

National Service Scheme at JIIT, Sector-62, not only believes in this adage but follows it to the core. From spending constructive hours in teaching the less-privileged to devoting days, weeks and months in instilling creativity among the little ones, our NSS group has indeed gone beyond their selves in taking small steps and making large impacts. 
NSS, JIIT Sector-62 is just a little more than 1 year old and we have already touched the lives of hundreds of beautiful souls. We have extended our services to orphans, destitute, special children, slum dwellers, and many more. We have donated blood, food, clothes, stationery, and many other essential items. We have celebrated festivals with them, played with them, sung and danced with them and spent many memorable moments together.

We are all together serving altruistically in a pro-social way hoping to make our society a happier and better place.
