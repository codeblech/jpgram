NOT ME BUT YOU ✨

"You make a living by what you get. You make a life by what you give."~Winston Churchill

The National Service Scheme (NSS) was founded on September 24, 1969 in India and every year we commemorate this significant day as NSS Day. It's a day to celebrate the spirit of selfless service and encourage young individuals to contribute to the betterment of society 💫

NSS represents a coalition of compassionate individuals united in their mission to serve society and enhance the quality of life on our planet. It promotes the idea of community service, personal development, and leadership among the youth 🙌🏻

Lets celebrate this propitious day by engaging in acts of service and spreading the values of volunteerism with NSS JIIT.
