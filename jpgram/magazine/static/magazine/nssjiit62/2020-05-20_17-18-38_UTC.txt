COVID- 19 is the biggest global crisis. It is made to be bigger because of increasing corona noise on social media. In spite of various initiatives taken by our government to contain and overcome this crisis the people are anxious and insecure which disturbs our mental health.
We as NSS volunteers could really make a difference by reducing anxiety and improving mental health of the people. This simple 3 step guide can help us to break the virus chain and combat this crisis. 
1)	Instil awareness:  The only way to contain the spread of virus is through social distancing and self-hygiene. The challenge is to make people understand how important hygiene measures and social distancing is. There is a need to create awareness across all levels so that it is practised wilfully and not as some government-imposed rule. 
2)	Instil faith: The biggest demon is the fear of the unknown. People are insecure. They succumb to fake social media news and messages. Efforts to inform the ignorant of the fake news and instil faith in them about the better tomorrow is important. 
3)	Instil positivity: it is the need of the hour. It is time to show empathy and concern and serve the people in need. Service in the form of aids, charity, volunteering as frontline fighters of COVID-19 , or simply video-calling and connecting to people who are lonely and in need of help. If each one of us can instil positivity in one needy family, we will go a long way in saving humanity.
Stay Safe and Stay Happy
