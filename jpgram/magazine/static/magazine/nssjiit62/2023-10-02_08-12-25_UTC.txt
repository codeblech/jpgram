Celebrated annually on the 2nd of October in honour of one of India's most illustrious leaders, Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti is a day of profound significance and national pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri served as the Second Prime Minister of India. His vision for a self-reliant India and his leadership qualities, emphasis on simplicity and ethical governance continue to inspire generations. His famous slogan, *"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan"* resonates even today, encapsulating his respect for both the defenders of our nation and the farmers who feed it. 

NSS JIIT pays tribute to this visionary leader. Let us all come together, remember his contributions, and reaffirm our commitment to building a better, more prosperous nation in his honor.âœ¨ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³âœ¨
