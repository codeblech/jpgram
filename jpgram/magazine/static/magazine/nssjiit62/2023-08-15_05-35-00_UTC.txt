NSS JIIT wishes a very Happy Independence Day, celebrated annually on 15th August, commemorates the freedom of a nation from colonial rule. It's a time of national pride, unity, and reflection. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³
Citizens participate in parades, flag-raising ceremonies, and cultural events. The day honors sacrifices made for liberty and serves as a reminder of the value of sovereignty. 
Let's celebrate the spirit of independence together!
