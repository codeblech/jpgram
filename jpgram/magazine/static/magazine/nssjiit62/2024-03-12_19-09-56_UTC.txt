Get ready to make a difference in the Arthala village community! 🏞️ On Day 4 of our 7-day camp, NSS JIIT is heading to Arthala village on March 13th at 9:00 AM! 🗓️

🎓 Education meets empowerment as we conduct awareness sessions on vital topics like good touch and bad touch for the young minds at the government school. 📚 Plus, we're diving into environmental action with discussions on water pollution, plastic waste recycling, and garbage segregation. 🌊♻️

But that's not all! 💡 We're also gearing up to boost educational resources by installing software in the school's computer labs. 💻 Let's empower the next generation with knowledge and tools for a brighter future! 🌟
