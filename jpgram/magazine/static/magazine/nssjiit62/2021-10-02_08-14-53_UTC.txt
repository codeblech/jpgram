Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed. 

HE TAUGHT US TO BE THE CHANGE WE WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD. 
HE TAUGHT US THAT WHERE THERE IS LOVE THERE IS LIFE.
 HE FOLLOWED THE PATH OF AHIMSA AND NON-VIOLENCE TO MAKE US UNITE.

JIIT NSS-62 wishes you a very happy Gandhi jayanti.
