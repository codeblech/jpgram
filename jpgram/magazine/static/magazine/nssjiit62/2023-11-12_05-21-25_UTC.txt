"As diyas flicker and candles gleam,
Diwali's magic is like a dream.
May your life be full of gleam,
A festival of love, so supreme."âœ¨

Dressing up in new clothes, exchanging gifts, spending time with loved ones and burning firecrackers is what all makes Diwali the most loved festival of the year.ðŸ’«
The festival  represents the triumph of righteousness and knowledge over ignorance and darkness. It is also a time for prayer, self-reflection, and seeking blessings for the well-being of oneself and one's loved ones. 

NSS JIIT sends everyone best wishes on this occasion ðŸŽ‡
May this festival of lights fill your home with love, your heart with warmth, and your life with laughter. 
Have a great and safe Diwali!!! ðŸª”
