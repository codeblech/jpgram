*Constitution is not a mere lawyers doing, it is a vehicle of life and its spirit is always the spirit of age.*ðŸŒŸ Constitution is the most important thing for a country because without constitution, a country has no direction and no order. Let us be thankful to those who gave strength to India and Indians.
We the citizens of INDIA wish you a very *Happy Constitution Day.* 
~Team NSS
