“Smiling face of every little girl is the signature of God’s presence.”

Girls are leaders,change-makers and the pillars of society.They have in them the ability to make a difference to this world💫
Let us join hands to celebrate the empowerment of girls and acknowledge their importance, power,potential and provide them with opportunities to fly high.💐
