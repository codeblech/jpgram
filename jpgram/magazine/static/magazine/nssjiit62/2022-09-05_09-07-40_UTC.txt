धर्मज्ञो धर्मकर्ता च सदा धर्मपरायणः ।
तत्त्वेभ्यः सर्वशास्त्रार्थादेशको गुरुरुच्यते ॥

“I have always felt that the true text-book for the pupil is his teacher.” – Mahatma Gandhi

The prime role of a teacher is to pave the way for opportunities and success for the students. Only a teacher knows how to carve a raw student into an absolute genius.

NSS Jiit wishes you all a very Happy Teacher's Day!

We will always be thankful to all our teachers for all the hard work and efforts they have put in.
