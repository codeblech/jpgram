Ignorance and prejudice are fueling the spread of a preventable disease. 
World AIDS Day, 1 December is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in 
the fight against HIV and AIDS…. It’s up to you, me and us to stop the spread  of HIV and end prejudice.
Until we are all safe, no one is safe.

"JIIT NSS 62" wishes "world AIDS day"

End the Dread…Stop the Spread
Unite to overcome HIV
