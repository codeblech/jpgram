ATTENTION EVERYONE!!! 📢📢
NSS JIIT invites you to join us in a transformative event today, as we converge for a dual initiative - a Voter Awareness Rally and a Polio Drops Drive for the children in the Arthala village. 
Event Schedule:
Voter and polio awareness Rally:

🗓️ 12th March
📍Arthala Village 
🕜 10:00 AM

By participating in the Voter Awareness Rally, you contribute to the strength of our democracy. And we believe that making people realize that their vote is important should be the first step. 
We also encourage you to secure the health and safety of the youngest members of the community by bringing them to the Polio Drops Drive.
Together, let's take a step towards a healthier and empowered future✨
