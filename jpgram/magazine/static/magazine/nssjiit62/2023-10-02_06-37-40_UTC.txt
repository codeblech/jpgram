Live as if you were to die tomorrow; learn as if you will live forever."

Given the title of 'Father of Nation' , Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi holds in our heart a very special and respectful place.The one who pioneered the values of nonviolence, truth, and social justice in the nation during India's struggle for freedom 

On his birth anniversary, NSS JIIT wishes you all a very Happy Gandhi Jayanti.âœ¨
May we all draw inspiration from his journey and build together a strong nation with unity and peace.ðŸ’«
