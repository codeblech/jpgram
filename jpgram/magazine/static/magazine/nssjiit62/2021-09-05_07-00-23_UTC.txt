विनयफलं शुश्रूषा गुरुशुश्रूषाफलं श्रुतं ज्ञानम् ।
ज्ञानस्य फलं विरतिः विरतिफलं चाश्रवनिरोधः ॥

Modesty yields service, service to the Guru(teacher) yields knowledge, knowledge yields detachment, and detachment yields salvation.

The art of teachers is to awaken joy, creative expression and knowledge by being a true critic, our friend and family as time demands.
NSS JIIT-62 takes this opportunity to pay respect to the ones who nurture us and help us shape our future.
Wishing all the teachers a very Happy Teachers’ Day ✨
