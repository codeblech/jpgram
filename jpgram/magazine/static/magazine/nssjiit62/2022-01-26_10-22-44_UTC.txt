India is a place where we teach gentleness of mind in return of arrogance , a place where we teach pacifying love for all beings. A place where " atithi devo bhava" is instilled in everyone since birth . On 26th January, this great nation got it's written constitution which is what binds us together. It's the backbone of our nation.
Republic day is the celebration of empowerment of the citizens of India.  And even though the festivities are toned down this year owing to a pandemic , we hope that you all will come together to celebrate the rich cultural heritage and diversity of our nation virtually
