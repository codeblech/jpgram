Vijayadashami or Dussehra is celebrated with great enthusiasm just after Navratri and twenty days prior to Diwali.Dussehra marks the victory of good over evil, i.e. Lord Ramâ€™s win over Lanka king, Ravana as well as the victory of Goddess Durga over the demon Mahishasur.
"Every day the sun rises to give us a message that darkness will always be beaten by light. Let us follow the same natural rule and enjoy the festival of good defeating evil."
May this Dussehra burn all the gloom and misery on Earth and bring you happiness and prosperity.
NSS JIIT wishes you a very Happy Dussehra to you and your family.ðŸŒŸâœ¨
