Charity for Literacy & Support for Tomorrow 

Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope
On the occassion of Teachers’ Day  and Literacy Day, let us donate something that would mean everything to someone else.

Boxes will be kept at:
ABB 1, ABB 2, ABB 3, Annapurna, Girls hostel, Cafeteria

Let’s remember: One book, one pen, one child, and one teacher can change the world !
