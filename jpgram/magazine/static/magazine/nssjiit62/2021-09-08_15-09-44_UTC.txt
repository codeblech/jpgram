The wealth of knowledge has supremacy over all the other wealths .It is neither stealable by a thief, nor snatchable by a king, neither divisible among the brothers, nor a burden to one , rather if spent wisely it always increases.

Being literate is our responsibility. It helps not only an individual but also the nation to achieve great heights. So be responsible and spread knowledge wherever you go.
NSS JIIT-62 wishes you a very Happy International Literacy Day âœ¨.
