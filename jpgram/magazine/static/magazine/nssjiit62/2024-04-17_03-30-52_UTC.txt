"Leadership, compassion, learning, truthful nature, self-control and tranquil – these six virtues adorn Rama, the best of men." 

On this auspicious occasion of Ram Navami, as we celebrate the birth of Lord Rama, let us embark on a journey towards togetherness, love, and devotion and let this day inspire us to live a life of righteousness. 🛐

Wishing everyone a very Happy Ram Navami! 🪔🛕
