A time for celebration, A time for victory of good over bad, A time when the world sees the example of the power of good. Let us continue the same "true" spirit. Dusshera is a day when Lord Ram killed demon Ravan and rescued Mata Sita. This special day holds great significance not just in India but also in several parts of the world. On the auspicious occasion, here's extending warm and heartfelt greetings from NSS JIIT to you and your family. A very Happy Dussehra to everyoneðŸŒŸ
