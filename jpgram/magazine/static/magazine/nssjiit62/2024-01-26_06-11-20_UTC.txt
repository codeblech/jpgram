Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose once said, "Freedom is not given, it is taken."

Republic Day, which commemorates the day the Constitution went into effect on January 26, 1950, is a memorable commemoration in the history of India. It represents the country's dedication to democratic principles and self-governance.

Let us consider the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity found in our Constitution today. In keeping with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's remarks, we honor the courageous people who gave their lives to secure our independence as we raise the tricolor.

May the principles of our Constitution continue to lead us on this Republic Day, and may we unite in our diversity to celebrate advances and resiliency that characterize our wonderful country. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ’«
