*Your chance to eradicate blood shortage*
Human blood is an essential element of human life with no substitute. Blood transfusion has been responsible for saving millions of lives each year around the world. Yet the quantity and quality of blood pool available for transfusion is still a major concern across the globe, especially in the developing countries. 

*Why you should donate blood?*
• This lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation. The need for blood is constant.

• It is harmless to the donor itself.
Blood shortage is a nation-wide problem and we all have seen it.

So we From NSS JIIT 62 invite you all to donate blood and let's try to reduce the shortage for the blood and help the needy.
