Aspirations are the fuel for our journey, the beacon that guides our path in the dark. Without aspirations, we can easily drift off course, being swept along by the currents of circumstance instead of actively steering our own lives. Aspirations give us a sense of purpose and direction.

The topic of "Aspirations Building: Why, What, and Where" is more than an intellectual discourse. It's an elemental call, a resounding wake-up bell to us all, to recognize and harness the unparalleled power that aspirations wield over our lives.

So , NSS JIIT in collaboration with  Pravah is going to conduct a session on the topic "Aspirations Building: Why,What and Where".âœ¨

Mark your calendars: 
Date: 8th August'23
Time: 5:00 - 7:00 p.m.
Venue: OAT
