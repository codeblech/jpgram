CHILD LABOUR is an ABUSE, for which there is no EXCUSE. 👶🛠️

Child labour not only robs children of their innocence but also hinders their future potential. 

📢 On this World Day Against Child Labour we must come together to raise awareness and take action against the exploitation of children worldwide. 🎗

Together, we can make a difference. Let us all do our part to educate, impart, and empower. 🙌🏻

Children need EDUCATION not EXPLOITATION! 📚🎒
