Hello everyone,
I am Priyansh Singh 2nd Year student of JIIT-62.This is my grandmother, Mrs. Vimla,  age 77 years. She was tested COVID positive on 19 April 2021. However on 7th May 2021, she was tested COVID negative. Now she's suffering from post COVID severe pneumonia. We tried our best to arrange funds for her medical treatment but we are currently running out of our savings.
 The daily expenses of her treatment is â‚¹50,000 (excluding ventilator bed charges) as mentioned in the document given below.
In this needful condition the amount of â‚¹14,00,000 will be required.
Please come forward, any amount you contribute will be greatly appreciated.
