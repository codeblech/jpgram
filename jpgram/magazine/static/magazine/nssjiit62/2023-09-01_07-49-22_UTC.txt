From the hallways of NSS-JIIT where leadership and vision took root, to the global corridors of Amazon, the journey has been nothing short of inspirational âœ¨

It's a testament to unwavering dedication, dreams pursued, and milestones achievedðŸ’¯

Huge congratulations from whole NSS Team to our former Chairperson Mr. Kratik Rana on this stellar achievement!ðŸŒŸ
