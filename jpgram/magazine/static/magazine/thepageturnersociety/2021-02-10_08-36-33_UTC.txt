“What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.”

But when we talk about John Green YA novel Paper Towns we can be very much sure it is more than just a book. Paper Towns is the fourth novel by John Green in the Young Adult section and was the novel that established the writer in the section. It tells us the story of a boy believing in miracles but also knows that there is only for each person in the whole world. He finds his miracle, Margo Roth, living in front of his house and then losses it. Until one night the Margo climbs into his window. This is novel has everything, the famous girl, the awkward boy, the prom, thrill, yes it has a bit of thrill too, and of course a betraying and realistic ending. The only criticism this book has received is that it is a little similar to John Green's previous work "Looking for Alaska".
If you haven't read that then you're good to go, and if you loved that then also you're going to love this.
