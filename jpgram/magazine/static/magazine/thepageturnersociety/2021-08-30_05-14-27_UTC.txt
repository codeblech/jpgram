"श्री कृष्ण गोविन्द हरे मुरारी,
हे नाथ नारायण वासुदेवा ॥"
An occasion for celebrating the birth of goodness over evil - "Janmashtami" is celebrated not only in India but all over the world to rejuvenate the birth of Lord Krishna, the 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu. It is believed that Lord Krishna was born in the era when there was darkness and evil all around. The day symbolises that one ray of hope which signifies that there can be no evil greater than the good and eventually the malignant will have to surrender on the birth of the benevolent . So, let us all burn the evil inside us at midnight and welcome the tranquillity and appearance of Lord Krishna inside us! 

Wishing everyone a very happy Janmashtami.
