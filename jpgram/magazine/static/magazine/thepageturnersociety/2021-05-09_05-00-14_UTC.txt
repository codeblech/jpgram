“A mother understands what a child does not say.” —Jewish proverb

Mother is our first friend, our first teacher,our first role model and what not. She is the one who gave us this beautiful gift of life for which we shall be always obliged. Her love is the purest form of affection that requires much attention.
On that note The Page Turner Society wishes a very Happy Mothers day to all the amazing mother's out there. 💫
