A book in the genre of Suspense and Thriller has to pass certain quality checks and we made sure that this time our Book of the month not only passed those but set the bar quite high up. Let me ask you this :
Are You Happy With Your Life?? 
Whatever your answer might be, it is assured that this book, DARK MATTER by Blake Crouch, will make you happy not just because it a real pageturner but it does answer the question posed by Robert Frost in The Road not Taken.

This book has a tinge of everything with loads and loads of thrill and it surely reminds us of Dan Brown. The story revolves around the protagonist, a physics professor, who one day wakes up in a world where he is not an ordinary man. He is to identify if that's a dream or some other reality of his world and must find his way back to his wife and son. 

We all are aware of the great thrillers written by S. Sheldon, Agatha Christie, or Lee Child but it has been long since a new style from a budding author came out that had everyone glued to it and kept those pages turning by themselves till there were no more to go on. This book clearly peeks into the future and gives a sight of what could be on the other side of world-changing technology and all this with a nailbiting end.
