"The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the worldâ€™s problems." 
- Mahatma Gandhi 

Today we remember Mahatma Gandhi, fondly referred as "Bapu" on his birth anniversary as chief architect of India's freedom struggle. He not only served as a true source of hope and a harbinger of peace for the distressed masses but also embodied unwavering determination, exemplified by the Dandi March. 
Gandhiji's philosophy of Satyagraha was the soul of India's conquest for freedom and Achieving his vision of self sufficiency and sustainability will be the honest tribute to his legacy. 
We, at The Page Turner Society extend warm greetings on occasion of Gandhi Jayanti
