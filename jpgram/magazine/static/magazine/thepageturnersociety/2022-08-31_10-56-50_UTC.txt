"May Lord Ganesha bestow you power, destroy your sorrow and enhance happiness in your life."🙏🏼

Pageturner Society wishes you a very happy Ganesh Chaturthi along with a good recommendation for lovers of Mythological Genre💫.

Review : 
"Ganesha, the auspicious, the beginning by Shakunthala Jagannathan is a beautiful culmination of Lord Ganesha's legacy, history, significance, philosophy and prominence. 
Our generation grew up watching Ganesha in childhood movies and cartoons, and a lot of us hold him in affection. The books contains a lot of pictures of Ganesha's depictions in architecture and scriptures and it's very interesting to note just how many lives have been touched by Ganesha's legacy .
The book is actually a multidimensional study of Ganesha's impact on the people, leaning it more towards sociology than religion. It's an informative book, so we wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for preaching or self help. However, those interested in reading about the history, legends and stories associated with Ganesha, along with archeological evidences of his devotees thrown in will find this book a perfect match.
