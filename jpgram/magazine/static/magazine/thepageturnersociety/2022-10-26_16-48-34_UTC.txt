"A brother is a gift to heart, and friend to the spirit."

Celebrating the unbreakable bond between a brother and a sister, Bhai Dooj is one of the many festivals in the country that signifies the purity of this relationship. 

Brothers always have our back even after we leave no stone unturned to annoy them. Every small moment spent with them, whether sweet or sour, is a precious memory cherished for life.

The PageTurner Society, wishes you a very happy Bhai Dooj! May this Bhai Dooj bring you and your siblings closer, and shower loads of love, happiness and, success on you and your loved ones.
