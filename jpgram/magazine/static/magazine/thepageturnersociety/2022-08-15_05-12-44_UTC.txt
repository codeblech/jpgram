Independence! A word that comes with countless  sacrifices, a celebration to own our actions, a "mahotsav" to regain peace, a feeling that gives us pride!! 
Re-iterating the words of our first Prime Minister with some changes, At the stroke of midnight hour, when the world sleeps, may India awake to life and freedom of thoughts. May the people emerge out of the internal conflicts and come together in unison for not only the nation but also for humanity and development. May our nation rise above the "fragments of domestic walls".

With this spirit, The PageTurner Society wishes everyone a very happy 76th Independence Day.
