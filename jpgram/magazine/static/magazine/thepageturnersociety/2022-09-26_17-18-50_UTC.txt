"या देवी सर्वभूतेषु शक्ति-रूपेण संस्थिता। 
नमस्तस्यै नमस्तस्यै नमस्तस्यै नमो नमः॥"

“The goddess who is invoked in all beings as Vishnu’s maya, we bow down to her.”

Bestowed with three eyes, representing the past, present and future, Goddess Durga is the divine mother of all creations, linked with humanity for the rest of its days. Being the amalgamation of powers of the mighty three - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, she is the one true force to put an end to all evils.

She descends to Earth, donned in auspicious red, on her fierce lion, and so begin the sacred festivities to celebrate her victories over destructive monstrosities. Be it Durga Puja in the east or Navratri in the north/west, it is a glorious festival to appease Goddess Durga, which also marks the beginning of autumn in the country!

The PageTurner Society wishes you a radiant Durga Puja and Navratri, hoping it brings you and your loved ones immense joy and fortune! May Goddess Durga grant you courage to overcome all your struggles and afflictions.
