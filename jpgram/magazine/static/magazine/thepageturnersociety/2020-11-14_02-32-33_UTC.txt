The festival of Diwali commemorates the homecoming to the nation of Lord Ram after vanquishing the Devil. So this Diwali let's celebrate the Debarkation of our loved ones after enervating the corona evil. 

May all your sorrows burst away like the fireworks on this night, and your happiness multiply a thousand-fold on this pious ocassion. On this day of  togetherness, let that feeling of affection fill up your heart so that no one has to solely face the evil.

With that same energy and spirit, The Page Turner Society wishes you and your loved ones a very Happy Diwali. ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸ
