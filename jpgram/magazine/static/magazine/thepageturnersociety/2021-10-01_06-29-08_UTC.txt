“That’s the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet.”~ Jhumpa Lahiri

To the people who love the essence of books, who could not resist buying new books while having tons of them still unread, who could not sleep at night for that “one more chapter” and  are intolerable on getting the spoilers. To the ones who abhor when the world goes against their favourite characters, who open up their book shelves for arranging a book into the collection and ends up reminiscing all the books and the stories related to them, who get stuck in the bookstore while admiring and reading the short summary at the back, who dream of having a large,peaceful library someday at their future home and to the ones whom we call a bibliophile or a bookworm~  we at The Page Turner Society gets you and help you find the people alike! It is a society that works constantly towards the love of books and everything related to it. 

So, if you are one of those people who feel these symptoms of a bookworm or are yet to become one then this society is surely meant for you. Hence, the orientation, where you’ll be able to know more about the society, ask your queries and meet your fellow bibliomaniacs. 

Date and timings to be released soon…… 

Till then stay tuned!!
