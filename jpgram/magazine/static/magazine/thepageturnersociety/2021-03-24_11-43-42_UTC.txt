Anime Recommendation of the Month: The Promised Neverland üìΩÔ∏èüì∫

This anime will remind you of the intellectual struggle between Light and L from Death Note ‚Äì this show covers a covert and ever present battle of logic, strategy and creativity between the threats and our little baby geniuses. 
You will constantly find yourself on a roller-coaster of emotions. If there was a scale range from cute to terrifying, this anime would cover the whole thing. You will find yourself thinking about the plight of the baby geniuses during the week while waiting for the next episode (Season 2 is on air!!) ‚Äì exploring ideas for yourself of how you would survive and what clues or conclusions could be made next. Furthermore the concept/story is amazing, beautifully animated and carefully directed with some great characters. Totally worth a watch! ‚≠ê
