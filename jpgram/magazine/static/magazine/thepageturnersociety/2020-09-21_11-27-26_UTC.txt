"You can find magic wherever you look.  Sit back and Relax, All you need is a book" 

Books are a unique form of portable magic... There isn't just a chapter enclosed in these books but also a completely different world beneath them.... They can take you to any place in a matter of minutes... You could be witnessing a Quidditch match one day, the next day you could be in Ruskin Bond's Mussoorie or maybe even recount the Holocaust through the eyes of Anne Frank! ðŸ˜‰

The Page Turner Society is happy to announce it's orientation on this Sunday, 27 September 2020.

Also, there will be a small Quiz before the orientation for some exciting  prizes!!! Sooooooo stay tuned!
