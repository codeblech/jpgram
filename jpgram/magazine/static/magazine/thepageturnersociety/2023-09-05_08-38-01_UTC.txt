मन्नाथः श्रीजगन्नाथः मद्गुरुः श्रीजगद्गुरुः। 
मदात्मा सर्वभूतात्मा तस्मै श्रीगुरुवे नमः।। 'Salutation to the noble Guru, who is my Lord and the Lord of the Universe, my Teacher of the Universe, who is the Self in me and the Self in all beings.'

On this Teacher's Day, we celebrate the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. His decision to commemorate his birthday as a day to honor teachers reflects the profound respect and regard he held for educators. His legacy reminds us of the pivotal role teachers play in shaping our minds ,the character and future of our nation. 
Not only a teacher shape our mind but today's modern literature like the movies(Taare Zameen Par, Harry Potter,3 idiots etc.) and the actors who play such roles from our own life can be a great medium to learn different outlooks, aspects ,ethics and morals to pursue in our journey of  life.
Therefore, let's express our gratitude to all our dedicated teachers. 
Happy Teacher's Day!❤️
