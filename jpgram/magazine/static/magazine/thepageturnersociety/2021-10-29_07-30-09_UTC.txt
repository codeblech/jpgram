WEREWOLVES howl , Phantoms prowl 
HALLOWEEN'S upon us now

Come one, come all in the threads of the season
If you miss this bash, it is an act of treason.

The Pageturners Society presents before you all our very first "Trick or Treat", an enchanting Halloween dress-up event.

This event is not only going to be fun (as always 😜) but also competitive, there are 2 tasks that you need to do, first dress as your fav character👻 and tell us about it in the Google meet on Halloween's day and also send us a photograph🤳 of yours in the costume. We will judge you and let our Instagram followers vote for the finalists to decide the winner.

RULES:

1. You can choose any character from any book or movie or web series. (Don't be yourself and be a spoil sport 🥺)

2. We will be having a Gmeet where you will dress up as the character and you need to come forward and tell us who you are and what is 1 thing you like about your character and 1 thing you don't 😎

3. You need to send your picture in the costume just after the event has ended. The link to share your images will be given to you in the Google meet itself.

4. And yes it never hurts to  be scary on Halloween ☠️
