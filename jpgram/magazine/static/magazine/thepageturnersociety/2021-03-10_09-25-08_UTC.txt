When it comes to suspense and thriller fiction there are very few names that one can trust and also it is found that almost 47% of the adults read fiction and every 1 of 10 books published is fiction. Now this gives us a good idea about how many authors are there in this field making it one of the most difficult tasks to pick up the author of the month in the area of suspense and thriller fiction. After reading the books of one of such quickly rising authors we found him - "Blake Crouch".
Yes people we have chosen Blake as our Author of the Month and rightly so as his books have already been adapted into TV series and currently his book Dark Matter is being picturized by Sony Pictures. 
Blake started his career with 2 novels in 2004 and 2005 but what established him as a mystery author was his Wayward Pines Trilogy in 2012-14. 
Coming to his writing style, he is one of the best handlers of built-ups in books. When you start reading him, the beginning won't make sense but what would will amaze is you won't be able to keep Blake's book down and turns out it is the case all around the world. He weaves the story with such sophistication that the  person reading it is attached to it. They say- "The historian records, but the novelist creates" and trust us this what this author creates is worth recording. (as also proven by Sony Pictures and FOX üòù)
