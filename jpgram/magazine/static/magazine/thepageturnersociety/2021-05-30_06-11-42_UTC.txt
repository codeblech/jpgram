Ever wondered about how Afterlife looks like?
Well, don't look any further if you want to experience that feeling virtually. So, today we the Page Turner Society are back with another mind-boggling and light-hearted sitcom recommendation: "The Good Place", created by Michael Schur.
This bright charmer starring (Kristen Bell and Ted Danson) is enriched with philosophy, ethics and contains answers to the questions about death and life, only for your inquisitive minds.
The series is stocked with a bunch of strange characters like--
a selfish saleswoman, the dumb DJ, moral philosophy teacher and not to forget the sophisticated, filthy-rich philanthropist.
These four misfits try to become better in the 'Jeremy Bearimy' (an Afterlife timeline) for sustaining in the good-bad place.
The plot has many ups and downs and also takes some sideways turn, turning the show even more fun to watch. So, wait no more and experience the bittersweet virtual Afterlife moments displayed in the series.
