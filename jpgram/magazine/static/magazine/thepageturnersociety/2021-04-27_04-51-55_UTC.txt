When it comes to chuckle-worthy, mildly clever, and road trip adult comedy, this is when "We're the Millers"Â  (starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis) steps in, and gives us a fun treat to our eyes.

The storyline from the beginning itself is very much engaging, which involves a small-time drug dealer who smuggles a huge amount of marijuana into the US from Mexico, by hiring a fake family.

En route to, Mexico the Millers come across "The Fitzgeralds", another bizarre family, and their encounter adds some humor elements to the movie. What makes the movie work is the spectacular comic timing and performances of the lead actors. What also clicks is the balance the story manages to maintain between heart-warming emotions and dirtiness. The story develops at a decent rate, with enough suspense to keep you engaged and curious. 

Overall, the movie is loaded with some funny snippets and gags. If you need a no-brainer to spike your mood then definitely it is worth giving a watch.
