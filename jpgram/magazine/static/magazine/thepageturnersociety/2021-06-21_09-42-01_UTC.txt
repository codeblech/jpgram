“Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self.”
It is an ancient Indian art that relaxes the mind, soothes the soul, and aims at the holistic wellness of humans including the body, mind, and spirit.
International Yoga Day with this year's theme: 'Yoga for well-being' celebrates the physical and spiritual prowess that yoga has brought to the world stage. The significance of this day is to raise awareness all around the globe about the benefits of yoga and also promote both the physical and mental well-being of humanity.

So, on this occasion we The Pageturners Society wish you a happy International Yoga Day and encourage you to live a healthy lifestyle.
