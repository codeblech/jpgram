Indians all over the country come together to celebrate Govardhan Puja each year after Diwali. This day celebrates Lord Krishna’s triumph over Lord Indra. We all grew up hearing the age-old story. 
When Lord Krishna told the people of Mathura to worship Govardhan Hill, as it provided them and their cattle with food and resources, it angered Lord Indra. As a punishment, he made it rain for 7 days straight. To save the people, Lord Krishna raised Govardhan Parvat on his finger to provide shelter to the people. The day he dropped the mountain back after Lord Indra apologized, marks the day we all know and celebrate as Govardhan Puja. It is also called “Annakut” or the day their food bearing mountain was saved.
On this day, people worship Lord Krishna, Goddess Annapurna (the goddess of food) as well as the holy cow. Traditionally, 56 types of foods are prepared this day and the gods are served first. Cows are garlanded and idols of Lord Krishna are made. People also keep pots full of different kinds of food grains.
