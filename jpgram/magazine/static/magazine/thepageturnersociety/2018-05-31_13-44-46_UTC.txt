Another year gone.. And here we are. Page Turner Society bids audieu to our favourite seniors. Thank you for guiding us and giving us beautiful memories to cherish. And thank you for being such a lenient, care free and lively set of seniors XD. Wishing you success in all your future endeavors.
We'll miss ya all!
PS: Don't forget about us, wherever you go.
