Eid is is a holy day brimming with joy, a divine day of celebration which brings ambition and hope to every heart that is pure and to every soul that is untainted. So, on this special day of happiness let us all stand united against this invisible entity which has created an environment of negativity around us. This Eid may God bestow upon us the strength to elevate our minds towards success just like the sweet sewaiyan elevates our taste buds towards bliss. May His grace reside within us all.

The Page Turner's Society wishes everyone a Blissful Eid full of health and serenity. ðŸ’«ðŸŒ™
