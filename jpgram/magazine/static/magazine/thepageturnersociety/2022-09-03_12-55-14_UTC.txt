"त्वमेव माता च पिता त्वमेव, त्वमेव बन्धुश्च सखा त्वमेव ।
त्वमेव विद्या द्रविणं त्वमेव, त्वमेव सर्वं मम देव देव ॥"

' A teacher who is not less than our parents , not less than our friends, and alone a bundle of knowledge and wealth in himself is everything for us, who make our journey of life unhindered from any obstacle in selfless manner.'
