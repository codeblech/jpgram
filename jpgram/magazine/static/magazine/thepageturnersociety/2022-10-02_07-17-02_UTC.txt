"Heroes are made in the hour of defeat. Success is therefore, well described as a series of glorious defeats"~Mahatma Gandhi

2nd October goes down in the rusty pages of Indian history as a day of remarkable importance for it marks the birth anniversary of a leader, thinker, believer and fighter who showed the world, the power of patience, resilience, tolerance and the spirit to bounce back stronger after every failure. 

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his unique way of inspiring the people around him will forever be cherished as we enjoy being citizens of an independent country and also remind us to give back to the nation in whatever small way we can . 

The Page Turner Society, JIIT wishes everyone a very happy Gandhi Jayanti. 
May the force of truth, peace and love always be by your side.
