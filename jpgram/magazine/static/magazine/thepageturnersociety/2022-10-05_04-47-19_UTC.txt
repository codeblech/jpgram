" Don’t kill, but conquer the Ravana in you.”
VIijaydashami also known as  Dussehra, Dasara or Dashain, is a major Hindu festival celebrated at the end of Navaratri every year  in Nepal  and India. Vijayadashami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in many parts of India and Nepal. In the southern, eastern, northeastern, and some northern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, remembering goddess Durga's victory over the buffalo demon Mahishasura to restore and protect dharma. In the northern, central and western states,  it marks the end of Ramlila and remembers god Rama's victory over Ravana. Dussehra is a time for celebration, a time for victory of good over bad, a time to get inspired by the exemplary power of good.
🍁So, The Page Turner Society wishes you a very happy and prosperous Dussehra. 🍁 

💫May the Victory of Good over Evil inspire you towards your victories.💫
