"Sometimes the right path is not the easiest one." - Ramayana

Dusshera reminds us of the enduring power of righteousness, honesty, and virtue. It's a time of reflection and renewal, a celebration of the eternal battle between light and darkness.

This Dusshera, may the triumph of goodness over evil and Lord Ram's wisdom inspire us all. Wishing you a blessed and victorious Vijayadashami from the Pageturners Society!
