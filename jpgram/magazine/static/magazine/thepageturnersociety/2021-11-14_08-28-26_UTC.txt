Jawaharlal Nehru said, “The children of today will make the India of tomorrow. The way we bring them up will determine the future of the country.”

November 14 is celebrated as Children’s Day in our country, and the occasion also commemorates the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru. He generally regarded kids as the future of India and adored them so much that he was fondly called Chacha Nehru. He believed that if we want to preserve our future and make our nation more prosperous, we must focus on the education of our children as strong people and the right education build strong nations. He even used to say that the property of any nation is not in its repository but its schools. Hence we should protect the future of our country and provide them with a well-rounded education so that they can lead this country to the path of success.

This is a special day that reminds us that children are the building blocks of the nation and deserve the proper education and opportunities to lead our country in the right direction and make it more prosperous.

Happy Children’s Day!
