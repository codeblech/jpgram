And the wait is finally over. Hult Prize JIIT feels elated to announce the results of the online creative writing competition. While for some of you it might be obvious and clear, some might have been expecting more but nonetheless each entry did represent what fashion actually means in a very different perspective. Also, it is to be noted that the results have been taken into consideration keeping in mind the bot comments and spam comments (excluding both). 

We have our winners as:
1. Suyash Kumar Gupta (2nd year) 
2. Ehsas Sharma (2nd year, BBA) 
3. Ritika Mahajan (3rd year) 

Congratulations for the win!! ðŸ’«
