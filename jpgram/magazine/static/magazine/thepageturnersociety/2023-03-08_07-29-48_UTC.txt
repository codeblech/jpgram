The splendour of colours in the air brings forth the advent of Spring, and a chance to start over again, forgetting past animosities. The festival of Holi is celebrated all across the country in all its diverse and grand forms - from Latmar Holi in Uttar Pradesh to Ukuli in Kerala. With origins deeply rooted in Hindu mythology, Holi symbolises the downfall of evil - the triumph of Lord Vishnu over the demon king Hiranyakashyapa. It also reminds us of the eternal love between Lord Krishna and Radha. 

The PageTurner Society wishes you and your loved ones, a delightful and vibrant Holi. May your life be full of colours - red mirroring love, yellow representing knowledge, green bringing all the new beginnings, and blue giving you eternity.
