Knowledge is best when its shared! We, at PTS, believe in sharing as we learn. Over the years, we have created a legacy of celebrating the culture of book-reading and writing. This time, with utmost excitement and enthusiasm, we are thrilled to announce that we are organizing a bookworms' trip to Daryaganj this coming sunday, 27th March '22.

Meet us at Cafeteria (sector 62) at 9 am sharp. We will be leaving by 9.15 am (by metro). 

PTS JIIT impatiently awaits you all to join hands and become a part of this fun and frolic day-out! 
Come One, Come All!
