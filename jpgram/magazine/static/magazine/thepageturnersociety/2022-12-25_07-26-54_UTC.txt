Itâ€™s that time of the year again when you get to be with your families again. Long chilly winter nights in your snuggly blankets, eating plum cake, with Christmas time family movies making way for the perfect pastime. 
From bedazzling the Christmas tree ðŸŽ„ and listening to Christmas carols and songs to exchanging presents under the tree, it adds a lot to our day-to-day life and happiness. Santa ðŸŽ… says itâ€™s time to relish this beautiful episode of life while sailing through the next velvet smooth and we encourage the manifestation of the same. 
Keeping the sail of Santa fluent with snowy flakes, the PageTurner Society asks you to embrace the occasion with a lot of grace. 
A MERRY CHRISTMAS to you all! ðŸ’«ðŸŽ„
