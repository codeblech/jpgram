We take immense pleasure in presenting you the winning poem for Right Writes, February Edition

All heart wants is a beautiful place to get lost. 
A beautiful spot , maybe on a yacht. 

All heart wants is to answer the call from the hills. 
To complete the hardest summits and get those satisfying chills. 
To experience the sun giving nature it's daily refills. 

All heart wants is to play with the waves,
trying to catch one and let the other slip away. 
To explore the mystery inside the caves , 
searching for the inner self and giving negativity a castaway. 

All the heart wants is a cabin by the lake, 
with the heartthrob by your side giving you the sweet headache. 

All the heart wants is to travel to a thousand strange places, 
to extract the very essence of nature and all it's beautiful faces. 

But, what the heart wants the most is to keep the beauty alive, 
to carry the beautiful spot wherever it takes a dive.
