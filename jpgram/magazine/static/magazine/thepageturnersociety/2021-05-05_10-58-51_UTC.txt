Once an author wrote, "People now had a ton of free time to sit and think and worry about all sorts of existential shit that they had never considered before.‚Äù and this is what is happening right now in the world. Every one of our's life has come to a standstill in this pandemic and we all are in dire need to understand how our mind is reacting to this situation. 
This is where our recommendation of this month comes in, The book "Everything is f*cked - A book about hope" by Mark Manson will help you understand that how one can take care of himself in these trying times.
Manson has constructed this book for a reader who feels like everything in life is worthless and those who are feeling terribly helpless can start to see the meaning in life. This book takes up several examples to illustrate what is being preached by the author. Also, the book allows one to retrospect his/her actions and helps them find hope.
We believe that this pandemic is pushing all of our's limits and has affected millions of people's mental health, thus it was high time we helped you all find a read that is worth your time and suitable to the situation.
Hoping every single one of you is doing Fine.üí´üí´
