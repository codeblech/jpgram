John Green the author who made us realize that love is not something which you do but something which you develop, the man who blessed the world of teenagers with a perfect definition of love with his novels let it be The fault in our star or Turtles all the way down. This month he has been chosen to be the author of the month rightly so Valentine's day is coming guys.

When we look at his writing style we find a tinge of old-school perspective with a perfect blend of words to generate those goosebumps that one might actually feel when he/she is in love.

He has been one of the best Young adult authors but the books written by him are very much on the top lists of not so Young adults XD. His novels cover multitudes and also tackle hard topics such as cancer, neurotic behaviors, depressions, and many more. Teenagers are able to connect with his characters and that too a variety of them. We have witnessed him write novels with a sad but terrific ending and what makes them a perfect hit is their touch with the world's reality. Well, it is impossible to condense all of his writing prowess in a single post so we will leave it at this by saying, as the world's teenagers say "John Green GETS IT".
