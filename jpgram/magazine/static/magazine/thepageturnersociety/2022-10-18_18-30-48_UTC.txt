"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."~ Cersei

When they said "Winter is Coming", they meant it !! It indeed is coming in literal sense.This Halloween month, don't limit yourself and your spooky side and join us for a fun and interesting event, where you not only get to express your crazily chilling side but also stand a chance to win some exciting prizes. 

Though "Jon Snow may know nothing", but we bet you surely know about the Lannisters, Targaryens and the rest of the big houses more than they know about each other. So join us for a discussion/fun surprise event on "Game of Thrones" & "House of the Dragon" and what better than having it mixed with the Halloween theme!! 

Date: 20th October 2022
Time: 5pm onwards
