The world feels too depressing right now? Let us help üòé
It's always hard to suggest an anime to a crowd where there are people who never have watched anything of this sort. And when it comes to comedy anime we all go to Shin-chan, one of the greatest shows (and we agree with it too üòù), but for you all, we dived a little deeper and found something that is a classic and falls in the same league. "Kochikame" is our choice for this month's anime binge.
This anime will surely take us back in time and we promise it isn't going to be a scary one a beautiful one with a nostalgic touch to it. The story is about the life of a police officer Ryotsu working at a police station. The unique character selection coupled with the officers' bizarre synergy turns each episode into an intriguing and hilarious watch.
So what are you waiting for? Let us live this April in Kochikame's era. See you all with the next recommendation.....
