“It all begins from an idea, goes all the way round to a plot and ends up being that one epic story.”

“BOOKS” are what a closet is to the clothes, an ink is to the paper and food is to the living beings. You can travel “Around the world in eighty days” and at the same time use “The time machine” to travel back in time for seeing “The boy in the stripped pajamas” walking straight into the holocaust while reading “The diary of a young girl”. You can create a magic at “Twilight” with “Harry Potter” by your side and hear the echoing voices of the “Wuthering Heights” till the time someone observes “The catcher in the rye”. While being the “Lord of the rings” you can enjoy “The adventures of Huckleberry Finn” and at the very next moment you may also be “Gone with the wind” ~ all this while sitting in a room and reading a book in the noon.

Owing to the history of books and literature and the modern day representation of fictions through digital platforms, The Pageturner society invites all the bibliophiles, readers, poets, writers and movies/series or anime lovers to it’s orientation ceremony on 4th October, 2021.
