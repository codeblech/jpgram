This Republic day I salute my soldiers,
For hauling the nation's load on their shoulders.
I wonder what derives their vitality,
In a nation full of corrupt people what motivates their integrity.

I admire their strength to leave their family,
So that ours can stay peacefully.
I adore their love for the nation,
As it is the purest of all relations.

I cherish those mothers who have a heart so big,
That they cede their sons to the nation,
Instead of enforcing them to an ordinary gig,
As they are the true worriers amongst the commotion.

This country would be such a better place to live,
If only all our concious was half as pure as the soldiers I believe.
With this conviction in my heart,
I pray thee, god Almighty, give my nation a new start.
