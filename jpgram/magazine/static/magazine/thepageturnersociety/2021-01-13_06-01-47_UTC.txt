Lohri forces people to get out of their cozy quilts and welcome the summer and Harvesting season in high spirits. The auspicious fire of Lohri gives warmth to people and also hopes for brighter, sunny and prosperous days ahead... 

May the withdrawing season takes away the negativity and gloominess and the coming season fill your heart with positivity and cheerfulness. 

The Page Turner Society wishes you a fun filled and blissful Lohri!!

Happy Lohri 🎉🍿🔥
