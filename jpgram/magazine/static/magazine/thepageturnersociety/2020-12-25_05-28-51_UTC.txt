Frosty days and ice-still nights,
Fir trees trimmed with tiny lights.
The smell of pine bough fills the air,
Pretty silver bells tinkle everywhere.
Glittering snow covers the ground,
Christmas spirit is all around.

Every year, the snowy season brings us the most anticipated gift of magical Christmas. It is the time to enjoy, spread divinity, peace and cheer all around.

With the Christmas spirit shining in our soul, The Page Turner Society wishes you and your family Merry Christmas!!
May all the sweet magic of Christmas sparkle the moments of joy and conspire to gladden your heart by fulfilling all your desires.
So, let the bells jingle, believe in miracles and don't forget to sing the carols.

Merry Christmas!!! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„
