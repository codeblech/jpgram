A fatherâ€™s tears and fears are unseen, his love is unexpressed, but his care and protection remains as a pillar of strength throughout our lives.He is that one friend upon whom we can always rely. Whenever we have a question about something or just need some support or good advice, he is the only person in our life whom we look upto.  He takes care of all our needs. Even without asking for it.

This Father's Day PTS wishes all the amazing fathers out there a very Happy Father's Day!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’«
