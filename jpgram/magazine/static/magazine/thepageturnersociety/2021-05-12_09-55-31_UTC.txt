Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear nursing caps! In these challenging times nurses have been our strength. They are the ones who took the first rows in the battlefield against this dangerous virus by selflessly serving everyone. They risked their live to help us survive and have been working overtime since the start of the pandemic. This Nurse Day, The Page Turner Society would like to express our gratitude towards all the wonderful nurses in the world, thanks for giving us hope in these parlous times. Happy Nurses Day!
