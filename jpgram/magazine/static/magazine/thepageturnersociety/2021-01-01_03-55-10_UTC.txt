"2020 was a unique leap year. It had 29 days in February, 300 days in March and 5 Years in April" xD

2020 was the year we expanded our vocabulary with new words like 'Quarantine', 'LockDown' and 'Pandemic', the year when wearing masks every time we go out became a new normal, the year we were introduced to Dalgona Coffee, the year that changed the meaning of heroes, the year we could just bunk the class by pressing 2 buttons! xP

Let's leave behind the bad memories and mistakes of the past year and embrace this fresh start by  moving ahead with a positive mindset and make this year the best it can be and vow to not let the negative times affect us in looking forward towards a brighter future! ðŸ’«

Out with the old, in with the new, The Page Turner Society wishes you and your loved ones to be happy and healthy all year through!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!! ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
