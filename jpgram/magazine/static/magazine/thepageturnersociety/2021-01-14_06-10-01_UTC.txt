Sun, soil and serenity. Worship of Surya Dev and welcoming the harvest. India and her beautiful festivals never fail to stun. The aroma of molten jaggery being mixed with sesame and being rolled into laddoos, being called down from the terrace by our mothers because lunch was served and us running down carrying our colorful kites constitute of our fondest memories.

We, the Page Turner’s Society, wish you a very happy Makar Sankranti!! 🎉🪁
