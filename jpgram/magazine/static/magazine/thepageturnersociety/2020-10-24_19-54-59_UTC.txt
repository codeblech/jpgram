Dasha (“ten”) and hara (“defeat”) or Dussehra or Vijaydashmi is one of the most pious festivals in India, the day when the world sees the power of good and positive energy!

Dussehra boasts its magnificent and ostentatious celebration in the fairs held to burn down the Ravana symbolizing evil but this year in midst of Covid we want you to join us "The Page Turner Society" in burning down the evils of our heart.  We at PTS wish you all a safe and promising Dussehra. Let us make sure Corona goes up in flames this year!!! 💫🌟
