It's Holi!!!!!
Colours in the air 
Colours in my heart
Colours all around 
No face is seen, no you and me
We all are we, no you and me
'Cause all differences are crushed in the all the colours 
Such is the power of Colours 
The Colours in the air 
The Colours in my heart

Everyone's a child
Messing up clothes is not a crime
All equally craving the gujiya
Those sneeking and giving colourful attacks of surprise!
Oh how I love The Colours in the air 
The Colours in my heart!!!!

Pains painted with colour
Darkness painted with colour
Hearts painted with colours
Smiles inevitable
Pains forgotten, Darkness Enlightened 
Oh the mighty colours in the air
The colours in my heart!!!!

A day to forget the mundane life
Those day to day fine needs of society
There is perfection in imperfections
Each patch of colour on us is a trophy
Faces painted in colour needing no beauty
The norms forgotten, Imperfections are the beauty 
Oh how I love The Colours in the air 
The Colours in my heart!!!!
