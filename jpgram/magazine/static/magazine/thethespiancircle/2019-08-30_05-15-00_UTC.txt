After presenting back to back reels of utter hilariousness like "Pandav ka Tandav" and "Abba Nahi Maanenge" over the course of the last two nights of Ebullience, The Thespian Circle is back again to set the stage on fire with yet another fascinating and enthralling piece of work, "Balidan Dena Hoga". You think you know what it is but you actually don't! So do come to witness how seriousness turns into tragedy which is now a source of comedy. 
Get set freshers, it's time to expect the unexpected.
