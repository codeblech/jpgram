We bid farewell to Rohit Kansal, the unwavering pillar of The Thespian Circle. His stern guidance, exceptional organizational skills, and tireless efforts to keep everything running smoothly were instrumental in our success‚ú®

He was a mentor who kept everyone in line, ensuring that even the smallest details were meticulously handled. His ability to get items approved and his dedication to overcoming any challenges that came our way were invaluable with his iconic dialogue "2 din pehle list de dena", not only managing the hub but also showcasing his prowess in acting and 'lafda handling'ü•∞
