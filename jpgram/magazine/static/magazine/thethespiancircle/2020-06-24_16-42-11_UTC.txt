Itâ€™s never easy to say goodbye to people you care about, but finding the right words to express how you feel can make the transition smoother and more memorable.
Sir, our team wouldn't have been the way it is without a compassionate and supportive leader as you. You've always been the one bridging gaps among us. Be it the strict sessions where you used to criticize us for being casual, or your super sarcastic remarks, it has always been a pleasure to be guided by you. Even though your straightforward attitude and last minute change of plans maddened us, but deep inside we knew that you had always wanted to bring out the best in us. 
We couldn't be more thankful to you for your endless support and healthy criticism. You're one gem of a person and have managed everything so well. We'll miss you.
