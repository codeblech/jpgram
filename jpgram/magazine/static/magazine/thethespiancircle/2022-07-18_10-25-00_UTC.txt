He wears on his head the crown of poetry;
He is a brave heart, firm yet soft and carefree.
Muaz Sir, the guy who keeps literature in his left pocket and theater in the right. 
He can be the most elegant speaker and the jolliest guy in the group at the same time.
With his unique charm, he keeps the environment full of fun and laughter.
His poems and his euphonious voice are loved and admired by everyone.
Sir, we love you from within and wish you the best for your future.
