"We must all do theatre,
to find out who we are,
and to discover,
who we could become." - Augusto Boal

Theatre, is such a beautiful thing that it can not be explained in the set of 26 letters.
There's nothing like being on stage,
where your actions and expressions speak louder than your voice.
This is the day for all the theatre lovers out there.
Wish you all a very
Happy World Theatre Day🎭

Jai mata di ❤
