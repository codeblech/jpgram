The wait is finally over!!
The Thespian Circle, the dramatics society of JIIT,62 is here with its much awaited orientation. 
 
After the vapid break of two years, we artists are eagerly waiting to demonstrate our showmanship and give you guys a glimpse of The Thespian Circle.
Whether you are an experienced actor or you have never been on stage before or consider yourself as an admirer of theatre and art, this orientation can be your gateway to an unexplored world of fun and glory. 

Sounds exciting right? Then look no further, leave the monotony of your rooms and join us on 18th November, 5pm at LT-1. All the world's a stage and we want you to be a part of it.
See you there ✨✨
