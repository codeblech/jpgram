There are some fairy tales who have dark twists, hidden truths and unhappy endings. Some decisions burden the soul for life and sometimes even remove the burden of it!!!
The wait is finally over...
Here we present to you a psychological horror act "Pyaari Behna", performed by @__adarshsingh__ and @koshi_sharma, and written by @__adarshsingh__ and @shellygupta25, on the not-so-auspicious occasion of Halloween on our youtube channel.
