Love is love.
Today is an important day, a day of pride.
We are absolutely thrilled to hear of the historic move to strike down #Section377 and decriminalize homosexuality in India.

A truly positive step in the right direction.
The Thespian Circle sends love and solidarity to our LGBTQ siblings in INDIA.
Extremely proud moment.
This is INDIA of tomorrow.

Love has no boundaries, Love conquers all.
