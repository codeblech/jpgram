Best people embodies both sides, everyone out there know him as a polite and jolly person but when it came to work and functioning we have seen his fierce personality too. A man of utmost sincerety, despite being a day scholar he was there with us in almost every workshop. We will always remember him as a man who never fell short of ideas, who always motivated us when we were even scared of giving auditions, everytime we were stuck, he made things easy just by saying "achcha esa Kar sakta Hain", will miss the hope induced by his voice.
