He believes in himself, and aims to reach the sky;
And inspires others, giving them wings to fly.
When things didn't go as planned when the skies fell in silence, we looked back for help, we found Mayank Sir.
He is not just an epitome of talent but a thread who knows exactly how to weave strong bonds.
He is the center that aligns the team into a curve-"a circle" in its true sense. 
His dedication to work coupled with a plethora of patience makes him the coolest guy in the group.
Sir, we love you from within and wish you immense success ahead.
