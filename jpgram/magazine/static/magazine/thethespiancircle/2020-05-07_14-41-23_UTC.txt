The Thespian Circle presents it's annual street production of 2019 "Shhh..." highlighting many topics under sex education and its importance in India. 
The play had light comedy and satire on the knowledge and practices in society. It is about how adolescent boys shape their perception about girls and women, if misleaded from media which is usually their source of information. Not only is having access to sex education that is comprehensive a human right,Â it's our fundamental duty as a society to educate the next generation.
