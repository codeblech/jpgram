“Sulagti dhuup mein chaaon ke jesa, mann k ghaav pe marham jesa tha voh….”
From performing "Khilji" on stage to dancing on "Khalibali" at parties he is unmatchable, the only sweetest and super sensitive "Ravan" you would ever meet. He worked in organizing so many events but what remained in him always was the thespian. For us, Mayank sir is not just a name it's a feeling comprising of comfort, love, care, and utmost dedication.
Cheers to the hope that someday will gather again at "Ram bhaiya" to discuss some old memories, and this time we won't let you cry.
