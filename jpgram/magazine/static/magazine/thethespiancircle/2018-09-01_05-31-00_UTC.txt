The people change...
The leaders change....
The scripts change......
But one thing that remains constant is the togetherness and unity while being scolded/criticised
And also the will to get back up,to rise and  shine and give our best on the final day!! ....
So TODAY AT 5:00 PM BE THERE WITH US AT OUR "JUDGEMENT DAY" AND WITNESS THE EFFORTS BEING MOULDED INTO A FUN FILLED PACKAGE OF LAUGHTER in "ABBA NAHI MAANENGE"
