You all made it so easy for us to say Hello!!
that even the thought of goodbye aches our hearts.
Cheers to the hope that we will meet soonðŸ¥‚

We can't imagine not seeing you around at the campus,
your loving gestures, your encouraging smiles,

We never told you this,
but we knew whenever where ever we will be trapped you would be there to take us out.

You taught us the importance of exploring different spheres
and of course, we always wanted to be as cool as our seniors.

We miss seeing you all at the JBS every day,
the things you all used to say have suddenly become so much special for us.

The jamming sessions, parties, fights
we were so lost in the moments
that it all got over in the blink of an eye.

Just wanted to hug you and say;
we will be there for you
like you were there for us.

As you always said
We aren't just a hub
We are a family.
