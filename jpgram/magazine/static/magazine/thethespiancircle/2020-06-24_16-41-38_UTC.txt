Dhawal Ambokar, also known as "Rajesh" has truly taken the hub to greater heights. From "Praful" to "Rajesh", his his comic timing has definitely improved our "body circulation".
He has written several marvellous plays, it was his direction that enabled us to win awards and hearts. He always ensured that no one is left behind in the process of play making and made sure that everyone learns and grows. A fierce critic who ensured that all our plays achieved perfection and never hesitated to go the extra mile to ensure that, always keeping the hub before himself. We will always cherish and miss his scripts and how his pen has given life to many characters.
At times he would enlighten us with his deep knowledge of drama and the next moment would crack us up with his sarcastic jokes and one would never know he's joking if it wasn't accompanied by his even more sarcastic laugh! We are sure going to spend a hard time filling up his shoes. 
It was truly an enlightening journey working with you, and we wish you keep inspiring people! All the best for your future endeavours. We are sure you will achieve success wherever you will go. The Thespian Circle will miss it's "Rajesh"
