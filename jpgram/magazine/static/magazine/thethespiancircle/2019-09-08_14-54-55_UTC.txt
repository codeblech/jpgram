⭐Lights.Camera.Action !!⭐ Oscar Wilde once said,"It was only in the theatre that I lived." We here at the Thespian Circle are pleased to announce the results after a lot of discussions and brainstorming for those who wish to live this life of theatre.
Congratulations to all those who could make it! It's not only your talent but also your dedication that will make you a great actor. Welcome to the family of these dedicated designers.
