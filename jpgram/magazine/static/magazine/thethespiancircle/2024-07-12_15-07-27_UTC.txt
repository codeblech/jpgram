We bid farewell to our incredible musician, the djembe clad warrior Pranav Chopra whose melodies have been the heart of The Thespian Circle, weaving magic into our performances and setting the vibe during every rehearsal🪘 
From the first note to the last bow, you have been an indelible pillar of TTC. Thank you for the countless hours you've spent perfecting your craft, for the energy you've poured into every performance, and for always being there when needed💫
As you embark on your next journey, know that you carry with you the love, admiration, and best wishes of everyone at The Thespian Circle❤️
