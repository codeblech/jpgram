Our mental health includes our psychological, emotional and social well-being. It also affects the way we feel, act and think. Mental health is as important as our physical health. If a person has a positive mental health attitude and approach, it allows them to work productively, realize their full potential, cope up with the stressors and also make meaningful contributions to their communities. It is okay not be okay sometimes but, it is not okay to stay not okay. Even if you have a mental illness, it is nothing to be ashamed of, but the stigma and bias shame us all eventually.
