“Chalein Jaise Hawayein Sanan Sanan, Udein Jaise Parinde Gagan Gagan.. Yun Hi Ghoomoo Main Bhi Magan Magan”
Koshi Ma'am, one of the most diligent souls of the hub is probably the best actor to enter into The Thespian Circle's hall of fame. From a spine-chilling performance in 'Pyari Behna' to a remarkable role in 'Rajma Chawal' every character she portrayed was impeccable. Whenever we saw her we always had one question in our mind how can someone be so energetic and cheerful 24*7.
Cheers to the hope that someday you will take us along for panipuri and maggie!
