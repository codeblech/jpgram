While we hate what is going on in the world, it has given us the opportunity to take a trip down the memory lane and embrace the moments that we made throughout this journey. We are delighted to be a part of this anokhi, dramebaz and mastikhor family that makes us miss our college routine and those meetings.
Catch the glimpse of the same.
Take care, be safe and keep hoping that the tide will turn soon.
Cheers to us!
