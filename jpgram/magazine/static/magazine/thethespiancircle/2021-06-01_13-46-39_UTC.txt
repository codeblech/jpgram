“Kyun phudak phudak ke dhadkanon ki chal rahin gilehriyan, Main jaanu na, jaanu na, jaanu na, jaanu na”
It was pure bliss to see her around, the way she talked, the way she encouraged us it was all so graceful. From "Pyaari si gudiya" to "Surpnakha" she did every role with utmost perfection. Most versatile actor you could ever see she could make you smile at one moment and scare the hell out of you at another, can't thank you enough for being there with us when it all seemed so messed up.
Cheers to the hope that once again we will see you saying hey with the same warmth!
