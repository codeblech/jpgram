"Every emotion and every moment matters on the stage."
The dramatics hub presents each play with the sole purpose to entertain.

To extend the realm of enjoyment and entertainment, the Dramatics hub of JIIT - 'The Thespian Circle', invites you all to its orientation on 9th August in LT-3 at 5pm. Be there to be a part of your first dramatic evening in this college!
