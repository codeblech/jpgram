And here comes that time of the year, that we wish never came. 
When we bid you farewell, with teary eyes and heart full of pain.
From teaching us to respect the legacy to handing it over to us, we will forever be grateful to you. Thank you for being the most amazing seniors.
Thank you for all the love and affection that you have given us. A heartiest farewell to the most cheerful, talented and extremely supportive batch!
You guys are unparalleled and we will miss you immensely.
