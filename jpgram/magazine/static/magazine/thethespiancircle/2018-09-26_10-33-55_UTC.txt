Rajma Chawal is about little things in our lives which sometimes make us happy and smile but sometimes also become a source of unbearable pain and keep reminding one of the losses we had.
Presenting one of our finest actresses, @koshi_sharma , in "Rajma Chawal-A Monologue".
Hope you all like it.
Jai Mata Di!!!
