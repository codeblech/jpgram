THE THESPIAN CIRCLE is back with a brand new "PHYSICAL" concept!! Come and watch "ATOM KA SWAYAMWAR" along with your friends and revise those mind boggling theories that were such a "pain in the head" when you studied them but surely would be enjoyable when we....the NAUTANKI-BAAZ explain it to you in our own style !

See you Tomorrow 6 pm 
At JBS AUDITORIUM!! JAI MATA DI!
