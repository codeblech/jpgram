"We are actors, we are the opposite of people"
To get incorporated in this family of opposites, here is another opportunity for all of you. The first round of offline auditions of The Thespian Circle is scheduled on 4th September 2019. Choose your departments, save the date and be there to reserve a seat in the most enthusiastic hub of our college.
The interviews for departments other than acting and instrumentalists/vocalists are scheduled on 6th September. Filling the provided form is mandatory regardless of whichever department you apply for. Mentioned below are a few things that should be kept in mind:
1. Everyone has to come prepared with an act of 1 to 5 minutes.
2. A group of maximum 5 can perform together, still the form has to be filled individually.
3. All those who are willing to audition for instrumentalists have to bring their instruments along.
4. People who are planning to audition for script writers, come prepared with a few samples of work.

All the best! It's your time to win a standing ovation this time.
