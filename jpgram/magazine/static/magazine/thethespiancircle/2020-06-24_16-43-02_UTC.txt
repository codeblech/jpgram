Aabhar Dev or The Expression King!
He is a kind of an actor who taught us how to live a character. He has been part of almost all the plays either as an actor or a mentor. Once you tell him a character and the kind of a role he gets into it in a snap and doesn't gets out of it until the applause stops. He has performed some most dominant roles as 'Tilasmi' and 'Satta' in our street plays and lived them so perfectly that we are still not able to find even a substitue for these roles. He seems to be the most quite person when in the team but he is the best ever companion for any mischief you have if he opens up to you. You can never get bored with him as he is a perfect blend of fun and seriousness.
Idolize him for the sincerity.
