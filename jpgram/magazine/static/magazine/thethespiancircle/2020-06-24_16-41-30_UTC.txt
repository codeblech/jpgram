Probably the most versatile artist this hub has ever seen. Be it acting, scriptwriting or giving background scores he can do it all. The source of all good vibes, Adarsh sir never hesitated to perform unconventional roles on the stage. From being as fun as 'Hansa' to being as fierce as 'Hafiz' , Adarsh sir never failed to deliver and always left the audience in awe. An efficient worker,a wise mentor, a gentle soul and a great friend. It is always fun to have him around. The Thespian Circle will always remember it's Murliwadak.
