Like every cloud has a silver lining , so does he.
Dhawal Ambokar proved himself by directing and writing majority part of our award winning street and stage plays. He burnt the mid night oil , sacrificing his own personal needs and took the hub to new heights. He is a perfect example to dedication and one man army.
Thanks for your guidance sir.
