Mr. BackmanðŸ’ª
The man who always got the back of The Thespian Circle. No matter how low you are or how demotivated you feel he would always find a way to motivate you and keep the Josh High. He is a true team player and always believes in the spirit of teamwork and collaborationðŸ”¥
He has constantly been a guiding soul and his charismatic presence has always inspired us to bring the best out of each other. Be his powerful Pep talk before any major event or his fun and frolic nature in the parties he's just a complete balance of discipline and enjoymentâœ¨
We bid Shivam Sir a very deephearted farewell and wish that he keeps machaoing Dhoom Dham in his Life!!!ðŸ’¥
