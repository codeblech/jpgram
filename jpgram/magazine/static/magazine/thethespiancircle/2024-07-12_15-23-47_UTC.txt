Lekhak Sahab✒️
If writing is an art, then he is the Picasso. The person who created magic with his lines and dialogues and added fine layers to the script making process with his wisdom and craft🔥
He always brought a plethora of energy on the meets and had been an active part of the splendid writting work of this hub✨
We wish our writer Sahab, Drishtant Sir a very genuine farewell and may he keep on creating fire with his kalam!!!❤️
