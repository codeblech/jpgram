Without any written script and pre-established ideas, you act, direct, write and interact with each other along with your reflexes. The thespian circle workshops are the best platform to learn, react and respond which builds confidence and creative abilities. The workshop starts with various theatre exercises followed by stage or street scene making workshop and the best one out of it is furthur scripted and performed on various events of the college.
