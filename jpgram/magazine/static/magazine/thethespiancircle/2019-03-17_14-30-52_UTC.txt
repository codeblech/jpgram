Where there is unity there is always victory. 
The Thespian Circle is delighted to announce that our annual street production 'Shh...', secured 1st position at Chorus - the annual cultural fest of Sharda University. 
We would like to thank our seniors for their guidance and support and also the organizers @sharda_university for such an amazing audience and hospitality. 
Jai mata di ‚ù§
