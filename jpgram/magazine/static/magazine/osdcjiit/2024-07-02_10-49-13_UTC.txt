Introducing Rathi, our student coordinator who is a big finance and tech nerd. Legend goes that Rathi once wrote a program that could predict the stock market with 100% accuracy. Of course, he had to destroy it to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, but the legend lives on.

He loves to go back to his wizard hut to cook stuff up with Elixir and tinker around with python. And whatever you do, don't challenge him to a Codeforces joust. Rathi's the chillest dude on the team (and he knows it).
