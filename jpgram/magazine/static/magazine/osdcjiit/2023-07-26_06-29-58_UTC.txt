Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

With the commencement of this session, we are thrilled to announce that we are hiring members for the OSDC and JODC core teams!

From the amazing clubs that encourage you to strengthen your GitHub, the open-source societies from J128 and 62 bring you the chance to develop skills and memories like never before!

So, are you a 2nd or 3rd-year student from Sector 128 or 62? Because we have an out-of-this-world experience ready for you, and it is just one form away! Noob, geek, or wizard; we are welcoming towards everyone who applies and wishes to begin their journey with us.
