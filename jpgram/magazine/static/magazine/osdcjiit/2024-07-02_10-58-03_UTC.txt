This guy knows about every piece of media under the sun. You've watched it? he's already written three theses and one dissertation on it. He knows all, sees all and hears all. If you fall asleep at night hearing about dune and spiderverse, it's probably because he invented a machine that transports it to your sleeping minds like some kind of twisted sandman. 

Whenever he walks into a room, daft punk plays on full volume despite the absence of speakers. He's the go- to guy if you ever need help with python or open sorcery or anything at all because he won't let you down.
