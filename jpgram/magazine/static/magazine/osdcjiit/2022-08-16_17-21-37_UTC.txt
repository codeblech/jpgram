DevOps, a field that has been just as much overlooked as it's crucial to development.
Despite its recent surge in popularity, DevOps still retains an air of mystery about it for a lot of people. (Spoiler - Not a first-person shooter game)

This week's talk aims at debunking it. On top of getting a clear idea of just what DevOps is about, you'll also learn about various DevOps processes like automation, CI/CD pipelines etc. followed by a practical demonstration of basic CI/CD pipelines, Github-actions.

So join in this Friday to an exciting meetup/talk. Look forward to seeing you there!
