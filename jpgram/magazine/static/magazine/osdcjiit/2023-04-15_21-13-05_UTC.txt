Now this, is heavy.
We are excited to announce this year's theme for OSDHack! 
And it's ✨Back to the Future✨. 

From old-school to new, exciting and emerging tech of the future, from the classic Spielberg movies to some obscure retrofuturistic sci-fi, we're excited to see all the unique and creative ways you interpret this theme and include it into your projects.

Once again, we have decided to leave the theme open-ended so there's plenty of room for you to exercise your creativity while coming up with your project ideas.

It's like Doc always said, "Your future (and your OSDHack project) is whatever you make it. So make it a good one!"
