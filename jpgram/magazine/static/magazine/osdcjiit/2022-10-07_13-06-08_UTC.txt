Hi folks! ðŸ‘‹

It's Hacktober month! âœ¨

Coming Tuesday (11th October), we, the Open Source Developers Community (OSDC) will be talking about Hacktoberfest, which is a month-long, international celebration of open-source projects, to spread awareness and encourage people to contribute to OSS in the month of October!

Don't know how to get started?
Don't know what 'Git', 'GitHub', or 'Pull Requests' are?Â 

Don't worry! We got your back. We'll be going over some basic concepts on how to use Git/GitHub before showing off Hacktoberfest and telling you how you can kickstart your journey in open source and stand a chance to earn schwags by contributing! ðŸš€

Be sure to bring your laptops since we'll be having a hands-on demonstration.

Venue - Lab CL1 (Near LRC)
