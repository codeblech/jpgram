Hello there!
OSDC/JODC is back with another cool meetup, this time on OSINT, Shodan and more!

You'll learn how to stalk people more effectively (and legally), view and control open cameras around the globe, explore unconventional websites as they take a stand against today's commercially saturated web and get more skilled at Googling your issues when other skills fail you (+appreciate just how rad Pepsi's website used to look back in 1996 (⌐■_■)).

You'll find various fun resources that allow you to do things you had no idea were possible, become aware of the struggle to keep creativity and imagination alive in today's web and learn how to git gud at using it.

Join us for a fun talk this Friday as we explore all these and more, look forward to seeing you there!
Date: 29 July 2022
