Hi folks! üëã

Coming Tuesday (18th October), we, the Open Source Developers Community (OSDC) will be conducting a talk on "TEXTING: Text Editors and IDE's".

These are the basic tools, your magic wands if you may, that you will be using in your journey as a computer science student (and upcoming professional). Languages may come and go, but text editors remain constant (kinda).

Getting confused about the text editor you should start your developer journey with? 
Don't know how to set up your IDE for your use case?

Don't worry! In this talk, we'll be going over:

- A basic introduction of some popular Text Editors and IDE's
 - VSCode
 - (Neo)vim
 - Sublime Text
- How to get started
- Setup
- Some Tips and Tricks 

You'll be up to speed with all the information you'll need to pick what's best for you and setup you dream environment. ‚å®Ô∏è‚ú®

We will also be having an online session on the coming Saturday (22nd October, 2022) on Vim (extremely powerful text editor) and how to get started with it.
