Have you ever found yourself intrigued by the world of cybersecurity or wanted to know what goes beyond the hacking scenes of "Mr. Robot"? 
This Wednesday we demystify the practices of cybersecurity and go exploring into the labyrinth of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We invite you to a fun session where we introduce you to the world of digital security and learn how to develop our skills by the help of CTFs. When it comes to cybersecurity, most of us are beginners and are intimidated by the intricacies of technology so this week we aim to help you by guiding you into the realms of cybersecurity.
Come join us 
at CL01, 5 p.m. 
on Wednesday, 8th November.
