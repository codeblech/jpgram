Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹
Have you ever try to look under the hood of a compilation process? How does your source code get compiled?
How does your machine understand your code? Magic âœ¨? Have you ever taken a look at compilers other than GCC or Microsoft Visual C/C++?

Modern day production quality compilers are enormously complex pieces of software that require a lot of background knowledge to tinker with. This can make it daunting for newcomers like us to break into the field of compiler design. 

Join JODC + OSDC for a talk centred around few important questions such as: 
- Why are compilers important?
- Where are they used?
- How does a compiler break down code into machine instructions?

This talk is for anyone who wants to know about compilers and about LLVM Open Source Compiler Infrastucture which powers various programming languages like C/C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift and more! ðŸ˜Ž
