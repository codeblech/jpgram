OSDC invites you all to CODEJAM-V4 which is a week-long music-themed hackathon "Give Life Back to Music". 🎹🎶✨

Spend more hours on Spotify or YT music than interacting with your family? Can't survive without a pair of headphones? Can't study without lo-fi music? I think we have an event that's just for you. A five day online music themed hackathon combining your love of coding and music. 👨‍💻👩‍💻

This is an open invitation to aspiring enthusiasts, offering a platform to explore, innovate, and craft projects centered around the theme of music. Whether you're a total beginner or a total chad with a passion for melodies (not the candy), this hackathon promises an unforgettable journey of learning, collaboration, and creativity. 👾

Unleash your imagination, blend technology with harmonies, and breathe life into your musical aspirations. Join us in this very cool and very fun celebration of music.🎶✨
