Meet Akshit "exitflynn" Tyagi!

Technical Coordinator, with a little too much interest in the artsy side of things to give a man an existential crisis.

After recently being awarded the International Cool People Award by the UN he is now officially the coolest ever, second only to the Pikachu also in our hub.
