Happy Saturday folks!
 
We’ve got something fun lined up for you at this week's OSDC meetup!
This Tuesday, we'll teach you how you can access someone's webcam, their call logs (and other stuff) on their phone while they're playing something as simple as Flappy Bird.

Sounds interesting?
Join us at CL-02 for an amazing talk and demonstration on “MAY I OWN YOUR PHONE“, where we reveal the secrets behind the hack.
