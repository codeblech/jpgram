Introducing Som, our technical coordinator. This guy is the team's monke man and makes legendary speeches.
He is a football fan and loves music. Som cooks up dope tunes which delight his fans, famously known as kukis. 

If you're lucky, you might catch one of his super amazing beatboxing performances and even get his special secret chai recipe (if you ask nicely). Master of all traits, Som can juggle a thousand tasks all at once without ever letting the crew down.
