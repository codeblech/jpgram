Teacher’s Day is an event held annually to honor and appreciate teachers and recognize their contributions to education and society and the lives of their students.

Indeed, teaching is a very noble profession that shapes the character, caliber, and future of an individual. A teacher affects eternity and brings out the best in a student. Teachers can change lives with just the right mix of chalk and challenges.
