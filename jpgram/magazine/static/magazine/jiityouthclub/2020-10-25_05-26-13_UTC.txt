Shooting arrows at the multiple heads never kills the problem, one head replaces another, killing it will take just one focused shot at the navel of the problem.
This Dussehra, let's burn all ego, hatred and anger within us with the Ravana. JIIT Youth Club wishes all the devotees a safe and prosperous festive season and may lord Rama bless you all with happy times.
Happy Dussehra!
