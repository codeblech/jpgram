"Faith is of no evil in absence of strength. Faith and strength, both are essential to accomplish any great work."-Sardar Patel

A true visionary, Sardar Patel is credited for the unification of India post-independence. India is more unified today because of his vision, despite the colonial rulers’ wish that it is to be disintegrated into smaller states after Independence. We can all take inspiration from a leader with a sincere and dedicated vision for his country.
We Cordially invites you for the NATIONAL UNITY DAY – Celebrating the Birth Anniversary of IRON MAN OF INDIA, SARDAR VALLABHBHAI PATEL.
