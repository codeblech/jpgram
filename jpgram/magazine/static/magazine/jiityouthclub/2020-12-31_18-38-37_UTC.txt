2020 the fastest yet the slowest year ever is over! Slowest as it taught all of us the value of time by locking us inside our houses; Fastest as all we remember is coming home for holi, #dalgona, #metime, #amongus and plots of few movies (out of 100s that we watched).
But it is time to make new resolutions, gear up your will and get ready for another roller coaster ride. JYC wishes you all a very Happy New Year!
We wish this year brings you all the happiness.
