Freedom doesn’t see colours or shapes. There is enough hate and violence in the world, and now we need to build a better future, full of love, unity and understanding. Here’s to a wonderful Independence Day celebration "Azadi ka Amrit Mohotsav"

The feedback received after the event has been massive. It is no doubt because you made this positively-inspiring program happen. Our gratitude knows no bounds.
