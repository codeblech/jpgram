In the world we live in, a plethora of geniuses exist, but only a few display hard work and persistence.

As we are on this quest to find people who can display this dedication and resilience towards the youth club of the college JYC, you’re one step closer to being a part of this immense challenge and putting your wit, grit, and spontaneity to the test.

Finally, it’s time for you to step up and prove to us your mettle and show us what you’ve got to be a leader.

We’re proud to announce that the volunteer registration form for the Jaypee youth club is finally out.

Students in the second year are eligible to fill out the form.

Form link is in bio.✨

Further updates shall be notified via mail.
