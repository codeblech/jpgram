Holi, also known as the 'festival of colors,' is a time to cherish relationships, forgive mistakes, and rekindle friendships. It's a day when social barriers are broken, and people of all ages, genders, and religions come together to share joy and happiness.

After a gap of almost two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are now celebrating Holi, and it's imperative that we celebrate it safely and responsibly. Let's choose eco-friendly colours to add vibrancy to our lives and make a conscious effort to let go of negativity and grudges by burning them in the Holika fire.

Let us also remember to spread positivity and kindness in our communities and be responsible and respect the boundaries and wishes of others.

On behalf of the JYC team, we wish you a very joyful and colourful Holi! Let this festival bring you and your loved ones closer and fill your lives with love, happiness, and prosperity.
