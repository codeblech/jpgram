है नमन उनको कि जिनको काल पाकर हुआ पावन,
राष्ट्र के हित कर चले सब कुछ हवन तुमको नमन है 
-Kumar Vishwas
Lest we forget. Tribute to the brave soldiers who fought to keep the lives of others in the city safe without caring about their own lives. 
Our thoughts are with people who lost their lives in one of the most perpetuated bomb blasts in the world.
