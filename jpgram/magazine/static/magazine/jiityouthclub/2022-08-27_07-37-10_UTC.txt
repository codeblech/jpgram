"The best way to predict future is to create it."
-peter F Drucker

Every successful entrepreneur that you encounter or read about likely started with an image or idea related to something they felt passionate about creating. This occurs even when the person has no idea how (or if) what they desire to accomplish or create will become a reality. An entrepreneurâ€™s vision is the start of a roadmap that will determine where they wants to go with their entrepreneurial efforts.
