Quartered in snow , silent to remain. When the bugle calls , they shall rise and March again.

Freedom is hard to get, but we were blessed to have it.
Letâ€™s salute the martyrs for the sacrifices they made and thank them for giving us our freedom.
So here we are for celebrating the great miracle of freedom.
