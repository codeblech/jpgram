diloñ meñ hubb-e-vatan hai agar to ek raho 
nikhārnā ye chaman hai agar to ek raho 
-JAFAR MALIHABADI
26 January 1950, a great day for our country, the day whole Bharat brought under one Constitution and one rule. Our ancestors have taught the world how to flourish with diversity and the gun is now on our shoulders to further concrete it.
JIIT Youth Club wishes all the proud Indians a very Happy 72nd Republic Day! Jai Hind🇮🇳! Vande Matram!
