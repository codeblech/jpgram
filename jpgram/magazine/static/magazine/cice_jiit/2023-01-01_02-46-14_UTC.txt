आपृच्छस्व पुराणम् आमन्त्रयस्व च नवम् आशा-सुस्वप्न-जिगीषाभिः।

"Say goodbye to the old and embrace the new full of hope, dream, and ambition."

A new year is like a blank book. The pen is in your hands. It is your chance to write a beautiful story for yourself full of dreams, ambition,  positive energy and filled with hope. The New Year is the perfect occasion to appreciate all the good things that the past year has given you and all the good things that are yet to come.

Warmest thoughts and best wishes from the team of CICE for a Happy New Year. May peace, love, and prosperity follow you always.
