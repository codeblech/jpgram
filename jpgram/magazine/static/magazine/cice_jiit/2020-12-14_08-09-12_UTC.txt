"All progress takes place outside the comfort zone." -- Michael John Bobak

Team CICE wishes the heartiest congratulations to our senior advisor Shivam Kumar for getting placed in Cognizant.
Coming out of your comfort zone is tough in the beginning, chaotic in the middle, and awesome in the end and this is what he always believed and guided all of us.
Thank you so much sir for supporting us and showing us that in the end, it's a whole new world for you to shine.
