Teachers are the guiding stars who illuminate the path of 🕯️knowledge, instill values, and empower us to reach for the stars. 
Their unwavering commitment, patience, and passion for teaching leave an indelible mark on our hearts and minds.That is why teachers are never ordinary, both creation and destruction flourish in their lap.

Let us express our gratitude to these incredible mentors.✨

Many hearty greetings to all the teachers on Teacher's Day.
