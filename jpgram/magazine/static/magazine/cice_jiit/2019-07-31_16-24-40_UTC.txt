A hearty welcome to our CICE family. How fun will it be for the members of our hub to wear the same jersey and get clicked together as a team? It gives immense pleasure to feel the spirit of unity and gives our team a style quotient. Won't it be wonderfully amazing to perceive a connect with the hub and the college as well?

Here's presenting to you a T-shirt designed for our first years.
