Teachers gave us all the reasons to dream big and all the resources to achieve it. They  are a blessing in our life. 

Teachers' Day is a day to express gratitude to teachers who play a significant role in the lives of every student. We all have teachers who have inspired us and helped shape our lives.

The CICE family wishes all the teachers a very Happy Teachers' Day!
