“You can’t use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.

CICE  organized its annual project exhibition on 14th October, 2022 at JBS Atrium. The main objective of organizing such an exhibition is to make the learning process effective and efficient with hands-on experience for the students.
It was an overwhelming experience to have all the tech minds with their amazing response that made this exhibition a success. This was equally liked by our respected teachers and staff.
