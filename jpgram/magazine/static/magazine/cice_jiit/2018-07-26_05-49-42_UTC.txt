The Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a landmark international treaty signed by nuclear-armed nations including the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China. The main objective of the treaty is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology and promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The treaty also aims to achieve nuclear disarmament. It is the only binding commitment in a multilateral treaty to the goal of disarmament by the nuclear-weapon States. India is not signatories to the treaty. According to India, the NPT restricts the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967 with properly explaining the grounds on which the distinction is valid. India considers the NPT as a flawed treaty and it does not recognize the need for a universal, non-discriminatory verification and treatment.
