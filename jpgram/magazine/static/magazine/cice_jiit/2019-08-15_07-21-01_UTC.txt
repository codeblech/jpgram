The relationship between a brother and a sister is infused with affection, care, understanding and lifelong friendship. Not only  this a bond of two kindred souls who share the same bloodline but it's also a perfect amalgamation of love, respect and faith in the right proportions.
May this thread of love enlive your life with countless joy, prosperity and peace.
CICE family wishes you all a very Happy Raksha Bandhan.
