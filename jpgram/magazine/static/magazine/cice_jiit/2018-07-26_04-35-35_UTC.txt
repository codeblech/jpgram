The National Technology Day is considered as a symbol of pursuit for technological creativity, scientific inquiry and the conversion of that pursuit in the integration of society and industry. The day is observed to mark the nuclear test that was held in Pokhran on May 11, 1998. 
The first nuclear test Pokhran with a code named as ‘Smiling Buddha’ was carried out in May, 1974. On May 11, 1998, India successfully test-fired nuclear missile Shakti-I at the Pokhran Test Range of Indian Army in Rajasthan in an operation administered by late president and aerospace engineer Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. 
Overall, five nuclear tests were conducted with the detonation of two fission bombs and one fusion bomb on May 11 and two additional fission bombs on May 13.
 With this, India became the sixth country in the world to join the nuclear powered nation’s club and the first that was not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT).
