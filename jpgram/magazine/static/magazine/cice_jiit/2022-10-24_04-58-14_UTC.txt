'Tamaso ma jyotirgamaya'

This shloka, "Lead me from darkness to light", truly signifies the spirit of Diwali. It has a profound spiritual significance, "Awareness of the Inner Light." 
A Festival that adorns the Earth and the Sky, a celebration which  transforms our country into a realm of countless lamps, a Festival that unifies every religion, every home and every heart.

It is a celebration of the waking and knowledge of the Inner Light, which has the power to overcome all barriers in life. It possesses all of the enchantment, grandeur, and splendour that  brighten our thoughts and hearts, fostering peace, love, and fraternity in society. 

Light the lamp of happiness, the lamp of wealth, and the lamp of wisdom during Diwali to dispel sorrow, poverty, and sickness. Allow the Divine light to shine inside and around us. Let this Diwali bring happiness and joy to the world by eradicating the darkness of ignorance and other evils that are wreaking havoc.

CICE JIIT NOIDA wishes everyone a happy, safe and prosperous Diwali.ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
