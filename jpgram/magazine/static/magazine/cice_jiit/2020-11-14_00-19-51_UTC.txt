"The children of today will make the India of tomorrow. The way we bring them up will determine the future of the country."â€” Jawaharlal  Nehru

A child can always teach an adult three things: to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and to know how to demand with all his might that which he desires & there's always a child within!
Happy Children's Day
