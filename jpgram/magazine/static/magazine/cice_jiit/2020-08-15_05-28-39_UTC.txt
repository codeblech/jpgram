“In the truest sense, freedom cannot be  bestowed..it must be won.”
Remembering the great sacrifices of the martyrs, rejoice in the spirit of independent India soaring to dizzy heights, blessed to have the freedom to soar the unbounded sky.
 This independence day, let us take one more step to make our country glorious in gamut of sunlight.
Stifle every snag in your way and execute yourself to the pinnacle of success.
CICE wishes all the citizens of the country a very Happy Independence Day.
