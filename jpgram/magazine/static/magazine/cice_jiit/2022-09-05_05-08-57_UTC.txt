"I believe there is no other profession in the world that is more important to society than that of a teacher." ~Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam

For a seedling to develop into a sturdy, large tree, it requires water, air and sunlight. The same is true with the teachers in our life. They educate us, shape us into potential leaders and become better human being. 
CICE wishes every teacher a very happy teacher's day.
