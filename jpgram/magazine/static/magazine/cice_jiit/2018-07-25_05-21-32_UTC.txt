'Today is not just another day, 
It's a new opportunity, another chance, new beginning. Embrace it.' Hello everyone,
CICE is all set to begin the new academic year. And for that, we welcome all the second year students to join the CICE family as the worthy volunteers.
Here's the volunteer form (just a little formality) to join our team of wonderful people and make it more by your valuable contributions.

Students of all the branches are invited to join us. Being a volunteer is a beautiful journey in itself because you learn from each and every task. This is a golden chance to boost up your talents and add a mark to your CV as well.
