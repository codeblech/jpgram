The man known today for his calm, courage and compassion in the face of oppression was not always comfortable before the crowds.Over time, Gandhi ji managed not only to overcome glossophobia, but to turn them to his advantage. His unease at speaking made him an excellent listener, whose humility and empathy allowed him to channel the dreams and aspirations of the masses. His hesitancy with words taught him the power of saying more with less.So, in a gentle way, he shook the world with his words.
This 2nd October, CICE wishes you to celebrate the  149th birthday of the epitome of non-violence and peace by instilling those qualities in ourselves and make the world, a better place to live in.
