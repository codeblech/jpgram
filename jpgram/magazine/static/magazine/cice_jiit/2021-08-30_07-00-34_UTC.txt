Krishna gave us the most sacred teaching of Bhagavad Gita. Several miracles and divine plays performed by Lord Krishna are described in the Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata. Hence Krishna is revered as Jagadguru or the divine master who dispels darkness and lights the lamp of wisdom in peopleâ€™s hearts. On the day of Krishnashtami,

May the little Blue-God steal your sorrows, and leave you with health, happiness, and good fortune. Happy Janmashtami!
