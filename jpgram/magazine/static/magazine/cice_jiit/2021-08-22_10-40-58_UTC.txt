Rakhi is a bond of togetherness, it’s a thread that binds life and hearts. The bond which brothers and sisters share between themselves is unique and bittersweet. They might be fighting at one moment, and the very next moment, they end up solving their quarrel because it's real and powerful.

On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, May your wishes come true, and may each of your days be filled with joy and smiles too.

We, on the behalf of CICE team, wish everyone a Happy Raksha Bandhan!
