When you witness the burning effigy of Ravana, remember that all your worries and anxieties will burn with it and pave the way for happiness and excitement in your life and those around you. 
On the day of Dussehra, we celebrate the victory of good over evil. So as we all have been battling evil for the past many months now, I hope this festival finally makes way for goodness and happiness in the form of banishing fear and providing us good health. Hope you and your family truly enjoy the spirit of this festival.
CICE wishes you and your family a very Happy Dusshera!!🙌🏻
