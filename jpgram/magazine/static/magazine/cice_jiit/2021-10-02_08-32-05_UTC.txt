May the spirit of truth and non-violence be with us during this Gandhi Jayanti. My best wishes to you on this day which marks the importance of non-violence in our lives. You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results.
Gandhi  Ji said ,
Even if you are a minority of one,
the truth is the truth.

He was an ordinary man who fought for freedom and became “Father of the Nation.”
Your life is a message for all of us.
He is a man of self - belief .

Let’s salute one of the great Soul of India.
 
CICE family wish you  a  Happy Gandhi jayanti !!!
