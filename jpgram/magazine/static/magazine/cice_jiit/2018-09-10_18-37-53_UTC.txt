Have you ever thought about creating your own circuits? 
We are not talking about doing wire connections on the breadboard!
We're talking about printing your own design on the copper board/clad. 
Does that sound interesting to you?
If yes, CICE is proud to organize "PCB Fabrication" workshop in which we will guide you on how to build :

1. ATMEGA-16(AVR) Development board.

2. AVR- ISP programmer.

Here is what you'll take back with yourself from the workshop:

1. An introduction to Eagle software for circuit designing.

2. Printing of the design on the copper clad.

3. Etching out unwanted metal from the copper clad.

4. Mechanical tasks like drilling.

5. An overall run-through of the board.

So gear up for the workshop and register your kit to successfully design your own circuit. 
Get ready to take a dive into the real world of electronics!

Cost for the kit:- â‚¹ 600/-
Team Size: 2(Maximum)
