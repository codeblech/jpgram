The nation has suffered huge loss, the one with magic in her voice our beloved Lata Mangeshkar Ji left us for her heavenly abode. Her songs will always remain in our hearts. May her soul rest in peace. CRESCENDO THE MUSIC HUB OF JIIT pays homage to the "Nightingale Of India" who gave her voice to Indian movies for more than 70 years.

Om Shanti🙏
