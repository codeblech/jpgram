Freedom is for everyone. It is the birthright of every human being. We’ve had enough of hate and violence, and now we need to build our new future, full of love and understanding. Year 2020 marks the 74th Independence Day which will be celebrated amid the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic in the country. The sheer depth of pride felt by every Indian as they look at their country’s tricoloured flag unfurl, is a beholding sight. Crescendo- The Music Hub of JIIT wishes you a very Happy Independence Day. Let the fire of freedom burn bright in you for now and forever❤️
