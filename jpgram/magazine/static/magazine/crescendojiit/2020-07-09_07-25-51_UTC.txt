“Music is to the soul what words are to the mind.” ― Modest Mouse
None of us expected that the Holi break will last this long and eventually, end the semester which was sadly the last one for many. College life is a rollercoaster of emotions filled with moments of excitement, tension, uncertainty and newness. It teaches us the greatest lessons of our lives. Crescendo The Music Hub of JIIT bids farewell to our seniors. Their wisdom, hard-work and achievements will be fond memories in our hearts always. You have always been the source of motivation, support and inspiration throughout our journey with Crescendo. We wish you the very best in life ahead, and may you get all the desired success in life.
Regards 🖤
Crescendo
