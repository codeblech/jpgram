"Other things may change us, but we start and end with the family.” –Anthony Brandt

 We would like to express our gratitude to you for being a big source of influence and for being the support pillars of Crescendo. It’s no gainsaying that you have profoundly been there for us and we have learnt endlessly under your guidance. 
Today, we are humbled to have received your company, welcome your wise advice and are elated to announce our Senior Advisors for the session 2020-2021.
Congratulations ✨
