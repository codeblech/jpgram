"We were meant to be together by blood. Instead we chose to be together by love."
The bond between siblings is perhaps the purest bond an individual comes across in his entire life. We at Crescendo, celebrate and honour the pious bond of religious love, this Rakhi. May this fiesta bring you close to your loved ones, especially your siblings. Wish you all a very happy Raksha Bandhan.
