Change isn't about making unprecedented advances only. Change is about the ripples we create everyday and the effects thee ripples have on the world. A society is always better when the women in it are not taken for granted but given their due respect and honour for their contribution in making it more successful and tolerant than before. Let us recognize the significance of women in our lives and motivate them to play extraordinary roles in their respective communities. On that note, Crescendo wishes everybody a very happy International Women's Day.
