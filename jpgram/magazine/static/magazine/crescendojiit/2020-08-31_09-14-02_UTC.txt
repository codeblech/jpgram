"TEAMWORK: the fuel that allows common people attain uncommon results." ~ Andrew Carnegie
In two days of meticulous interviews, we had a great time listening to all of your answers and it was really difficult to make a selection. Finally now, the core team of Crescendo is elated to announce the  volunteers for the session 2020-2021.  We welcome them to the family of Crescendo and together, we hope to take this ace hub to fly higher than ever.
Congratulations Everyone! Welcome aboard!
