From the soothing lyrics of Moon River in the 60s to the mind bending production of Tame Impala music has never been about  following an algorithm  but rather it has always been about finding  your  own voice as an artist. Leaving behind the barriers of country, state, city, language and even genre music has always been about the art music itself and so have Crescendo. Here, at Crescendo the only thing that we care about is your dedication to the art of music itself and nothing else.

With that said we bring you an opportunity to become a part of our crescendo family .
