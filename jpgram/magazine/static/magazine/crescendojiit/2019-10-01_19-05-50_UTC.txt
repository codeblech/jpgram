A man who believed in simple living and high thinking. Gandhi's life story is full of courage, determination and religious willpower. His timeless message still holds true - to combat injustice and cruelty with the means of love, truth and non violence. 
Today, commemorating him on his 150th birthday, the family of Crescendo wishes you a very Happy Gandhi Jayanti.
