“We call ourselves 'Bayaan' because we want to express ourselves through our music. Each one of us has had diverse experiences in life”.
This alternative rock band is all about progressive music consisting of five members, with everyone talented enough to be noticed individually. With lyrics nothing less than a piece of lucid poetry and the musical arrangement  resonating with young minds on a whole new level, their music has entered an entirely new dimension altogether.
Start your week getting inspired by their musical finesse and immerse yourself in the depths of their ballads. Have a great week ahead!
