Meet Gaurav, a cool dude. Always giving obscure movie recommendations. Has an almost predatory gaze while singing but is really just having trouble remembering the lyrics. When he sings though, his passion shines through. Picture him rocking out on stage with a killer performance, belting out those hard-hitting notes, even as he wrestles with the lyrics. Now thatâ€™s cool.
