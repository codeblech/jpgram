With an ebullient gleam of Diyas and the persisting echoes of divine chants, may happiness and contentment fill your life. An occasion to celebrate victory over defeat, light over darkness, awareness Over ignorance, an occasion to celebrate life. May this auspicious occasion light up your life with happiness, joy, and peace!

Crescendo wishes you and your loved ones a very Happy Diwali!âœ¨
