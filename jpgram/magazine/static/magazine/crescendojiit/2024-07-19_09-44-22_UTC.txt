“Meet Sushweta, often known as sushy. Ten years ago, she started her musical adventure with classical tunes. Along the way, she had her fair share of ‘oops’ moments, but she didn’t fret (pun intended). She took them in stride and learned from them. Whether she’s strumming a guitar or tinkling the piano keys, Sushweta’s musical journey keeps hitting all the right notes – and a few puns!” 🎵✨

(Note: She can yap about Hozier for hours, so be prepared for a lyrical lecture!)
