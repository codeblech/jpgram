Before we begin a new year,

Let's cherish the friends we made and let go of the people we lost,

Celebrate the wins and
learn from the mistakes,

Hold the happy memories tighter to the heart,
Put the sad ones in the closed drawer.

 It's time to love ourselves a bit more and let that love flow. 

Let us bid the old year a teary goodbye and welcome the new year with a big smile.

Crescendo Family wishes you a very happy New Year 🎊✨️
