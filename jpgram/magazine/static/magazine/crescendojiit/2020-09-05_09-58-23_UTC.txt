A teacher is like the rudder to a ship, the lighthouse to the boat which might lose direction. Today, on the auspicious occasion of Teachers' Day, we would like to take this opportunity to thank all our educators who've been our mentors, guides, friends and companions and given us knowledge and direction throughout our lives. We acknowledge your role and appreciate your contribution in shaping our lives.
