Our flag does not fly because the wind moves it, it flies with the last breath of each soldier who died protecting it.

Crescendo the music hub of JIIT is going to give a musical tribute to those revolutionaries & the brave hearts who laid their lives in bringing India's independence. 
Jai HindðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
