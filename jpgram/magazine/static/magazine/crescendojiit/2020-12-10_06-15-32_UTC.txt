It’s one thing to just listen to music, but to really feel it is something completely different. There are only a very few artists in this world that can make you feel things, that can make you feel emotions you haven’t experienced before, and “Dream Note” is one of them. It’s impossible not to think about your past, about the things that you could have done as they sing about unrequited love and lost time. Enjoy your week by listening to their music and don’t forget to take notes, cause it’s not always that bad to think about yout past is it? Maybe you will find something that you were looking for.
Have a great week!
