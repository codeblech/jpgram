“Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.” ― Plato
College life is considered to be one of the favourite chapters of an individual's life. A chapter full of dreams, hopes, aspirations and vehement efforts. Bidding farewell to this period, our seniors are all set to start a fresh innings. Crescendo the music society of JIIT is thankful to our seniors for creating a whole new world for the beginners. Crescendo has always been a home to the fresh talents and would always be. We wish them a good fortune for their upcoming endeavours and promise to uphold their legacy.
