Christmas is all about giving without a thought of getting. It is about discarding the meaningless and stressing on the true values. 
With that very spirit, we wish you  a Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year.
May the stars shine on you brighter than ever and may the warmth of festivities fill your minds and souls up with enthusiasm and gaiety.
