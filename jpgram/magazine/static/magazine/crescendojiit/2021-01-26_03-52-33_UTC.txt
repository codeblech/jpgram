“Constitution is not a mere lawyer's document, it is a vehicle of Life, and its spirit is always the spirit of age.” – BR Ambedkar.
Freedom in the mind, strength in the words, pureness in our blood, pride in our souls, zeal in our hearts and a thousand salutes to the great nation of ours. May it become even more prosperous. Crescendo wishes you a very Happy Republic Day!
