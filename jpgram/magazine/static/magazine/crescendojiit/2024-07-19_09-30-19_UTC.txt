Meet Hitendra. Always fascinated with the guitar, he’s a self-taught guitarist and passionate about using music as his form of expression. From an awestruck child watching performances to giving them in college, he’s grateful for every opportunity. Hitendra’s music taste spans metal, rock, hip-hop, indie, and soft Bollywood, with a deeper love for indie and metal. He jokingly gatekeeps his favorite songs, so if he shares them with you, consider yourself as a bestie ;) For him, listening to music is a ritual, not a hobby. When “unemployed” (his term for free time), he’s either watching anime (ready to debate on a cliff’s edge) or playing lawn tennis. A social being, Hitendra loves interacting with others, always bringing a fun and smooth vibe to every conversation (+1000 aura)
