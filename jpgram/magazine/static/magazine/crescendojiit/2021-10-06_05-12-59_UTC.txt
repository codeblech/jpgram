“No one can whistle a Symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.”
To do anything of lasting value, it takes a whole team of individuals. 
Individuals that can keep the fire burning and take the hub forward towards new heights. Working for the hub has been a great pleasure for us and after managing the hub for a year it is time to pass on the baton and introduce new individuals that will represent Crescendo. 
We’re pleased to announce the Crescendo Core team for the year 2021.
