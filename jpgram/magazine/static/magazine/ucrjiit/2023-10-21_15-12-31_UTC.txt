In every chapter of the Î¼CR Robotics Hub story, there are individuals who leave an indelible mark, and our  ex-coordinator is undeniably one of them.ðŸŽ“

Î¼CR hub is delighted to share that our senior Jatin Agarwal has wrapped up his placement at GreyBðŸŽ‰.ðŸŽŠ

From the first day he joined, to the countless hours he devoted, his spirit has been our North Star, guiding us towards excellence. His patience, dedication, and unyielding passion have not only driven our projects forward but also shaped the hearts and minds of every member he touched. âœ¨

The legacy he leaves behind at Î¼CR Robotics is immense, and although his daily presence will be sorely missed, we take solace in the fact that the foundations he helped lay will continue to guide us. Congratulations on your new journey! May it be as impactful and inspiring as the one you've had with us. ðŸŒŸ
