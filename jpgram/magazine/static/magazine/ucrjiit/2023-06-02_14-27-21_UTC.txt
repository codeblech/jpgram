Unfathomable joy is what fills the atmosphere around us right now. It's a moment of sheer delight for everybody who's a part of ucr as we take a look at our former Senior Advisor, 𝐒𝐡𝐮𝐛𝐡𝐚𝐦 𝐆𝐮𝐩𝐭𝐚 Sir's achievement.

𝐊𝐞𝐲𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚 has procured not only an excellent technical engineer who possesses outstanding skills and deep knowledge but also an employee with an inspirational character and great charisma.

Shubham sir might be leaving us to move forward on his own journey but he has left behind a legacy which will be remembered for ages to come. His contributions to our hub and the entire college are nothing short of a wonder.

We wish him nothing but well wishes of fortune and success for him as Shubham sir goes ahead to work at Keyence.

Regards
Team µcr
