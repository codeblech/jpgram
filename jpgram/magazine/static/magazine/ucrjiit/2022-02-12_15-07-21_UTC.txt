"Opportunities will pass on like a person in crowd if you don't carry the vision to identify them."

So, Don your sherlock hats and become a part of this robotic saga in a neck-to-neck race against the clock. 

Test out your knowledge as an enthusiast, as a geek, as an electronic scrap collector as the Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Club brings to you - ROBOVERSE, where you traverse through a series of questions, deciphering and answering them to identify a given bot. All you need is a keen eye for details and an Internet connection! 

Get ready, to not only win big, but also to learn and level up.
So, READY.SET.AND TINKER !!
