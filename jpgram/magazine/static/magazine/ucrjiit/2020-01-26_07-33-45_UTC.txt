"Pride" is a word synonymous with "Indian" and blessed are those who have the fortune to be called one

71st republic day is the time to recall the Famous Vande Matram, the chant that gave us freedom. Let us make a pledge to struggle for justice, freedom and equal rights for every citizen, for peace and unity among all the citizens of this nation. Our ancestors strove to make India reach its glory and prestige again. So today Let us also make a promise to come forward to fulfill our duty towards the land which has given us all so much.

Happy Republic Day! May the Indian spirit prosper forever.
