"No matter how dim it may be, the light of truth will always prevail." 

Dussehra is the day of triumph of righteousness and morality. For an intelligent robot to function successfully in our society, to  cooperate with humans it must act morally. Likewise we might hope that efforts to design moral and ethical systems for robots will draw upon, and contribute to, a deeper understanding of morality, ethics, and trust among human beings. 
Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub JIIT wishes Happy Dussehra to you and your family. On this auspicious occasion, we wish the colour, bliss, and beauty of this festival will be with you throughout the year! Happy Dussehra‚ú®üèπ

Team ŒºCR
