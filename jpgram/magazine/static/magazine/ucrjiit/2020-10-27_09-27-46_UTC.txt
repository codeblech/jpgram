“If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.”

As the new session marks its beginning, Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub is here to announce the hardworking individuals who have amalgamated to form the new managing team. 

We wish them all the success and good luck and believe that their dedication will take the hub to new horizons and will create a new benchmark. Always remember that, "he who is not everyday conquering some fear has not learned the secret of life."

Team μCR!
