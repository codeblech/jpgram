Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics hub congratulates our former coordinator, 𝐕𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐚 𝐌𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐥 for being placed as a 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 at 𝐇𝐞𝐯𝐨𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚.
Excellence is an art won by training and habituation and she proved it. Her ability, hard work and determination brought her car on the road of excellence.
This hub will always remember your tremendous and effortful contributions. We wish you continued success in all of your creative endeavors.
