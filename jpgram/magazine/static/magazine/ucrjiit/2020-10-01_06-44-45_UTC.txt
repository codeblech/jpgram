Greetings to all!
The last few months may have been drenched in boredom for most of us but no more!
Gear up, get ready and feel the adrenaline rush as Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub begins its hunt for people who make µCR what it is - The Volunteers.
We, at µCR, are a bunch of tech enthusiasts, constantly striving to put our basic tech knowledge to some creative practical use. Here work and fun go hand in hand. With us you learn, enjoy and get the warmth of an extended family for life. 
µCR is all set to begin its 2020-2021 journey, and invites volunteers to join in.
So tap on the link and fill the form for we can’t wait to begin this jaunt with you all!
