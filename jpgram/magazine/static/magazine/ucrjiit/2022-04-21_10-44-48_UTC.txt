It's true that The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it. But why can't we avoid it?
Î¼CR invites all the first and second years to join our autonomous robotics workshop in which we'll be guiding you on how to build a bluetooth controlled obstacle avoiding robot. But, to start with you need to get your hardware kits, and for this you need to get yourself registered.
