"Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all others because you were born in it"
An occasion to celebrate what's common to us all, our Indianness.
In high spirits we commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was established, with a whole lot of pomp and grandeur. This day celebrates our nation's brave heroes, and the right of the citizens to be able to choose their government and exercise the rights that came with the Constitution.
We, the team of μCR,  wish you all a very HAPPY 73ʳᵈ REPUBLIC DAY. Let's follow the footsteps of our great leaders in making India the best country in the world.

Regards
Team μCR
