“𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒏𝒐𝒘 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒅 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒐𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝒐𝒏𝒍𝒚 𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒅.”–William Blake 

Over the years, our hub has supported the passion of hundreds of technical enthusiasts. While we work together as a team on designing spectacular manual and automated robots, we learn and innovate. While we organize magnificent events from scratch, we create joyful memories that we will treasure forever.
Our hub has offered us a platform to grow and glow. On that note, we take an initiative to celebrate the spirit of unity, talent, and years of hard work through this exhibition.
