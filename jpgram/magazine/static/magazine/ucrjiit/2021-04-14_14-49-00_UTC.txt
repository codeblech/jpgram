Locked up in lockdown is incomplete without _Among us_. Crewmates must hurry up and try to complete a set of tasks while trying to root out and avoid getting scathed  by the doings of the imposters.

With this motive, Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub presents to you "Evil Electrician". Be a part of an interactive quiz & figure out the innocent crewmate out of the 3 _imposters_ you'll see. Only the right combination of decisiveness and speed can help you avoid getting flustered when the tides turn against you🔪.
