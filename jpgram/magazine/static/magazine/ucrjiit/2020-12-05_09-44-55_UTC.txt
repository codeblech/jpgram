“People who wonder if the glass is half empty or full miss the point. The glass is refillable.”
μCR JIIT is delightful in announcing that our former coordinator, Kaushal Bhansali is placed in "Amazon" as an SDE intern.
This well-deserved achievement is a result of consistent hard work. The ability to gain knowledge through everything has taken him to a new height of success. We extend our heartiest congratulations to him as he continues to soar high and make us proud.
We wish him all the good luck on his journey ahead.

Regards!
Team μCR
