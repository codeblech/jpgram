"Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties."
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage and spirit to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
As the new year renews all the happiness and good tidings, hope the joyful spirit keeps glowing in your heart forever! Happy New Year!!
