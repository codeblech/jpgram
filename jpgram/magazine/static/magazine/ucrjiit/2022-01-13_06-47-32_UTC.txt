"If you tickle the Earth with a hoe, the harvest would make her laugh”

With the passing of the winter solstice, let this harvest season bring prosperity and positivity into our lives.
As the fire of Lohri flourishes, let its warmth reach out to us as love and embrace. We, the team of μCR wishes you all a very
Happy Lohri !!

Regards
Team μCR
