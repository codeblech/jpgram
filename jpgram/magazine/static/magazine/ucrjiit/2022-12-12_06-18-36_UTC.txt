After two weeks of rigorous learning and building a robot from scratch with perfect circuitry, the newest members of the μcr hub have demonstrated outstanding performance with their bots on the challenging 𝕊𝔸𝔹𝕆𝕋𝔼𝕌ℝ TRACK✨ 

It is never about winning. It is about the spirit with which one marches to the battlefield. 

We were overwhelmed by energetic, youthful spirit of participation, which made the 𝕊𝔸𝔹𝕆𝕋𝔼𝕌ℝ event, a great success💫

To all participants, winners and volunteers👏, who were the reason behind the success of this event; Thank you for adding more value to the legacy of the μcr hub. 

Congratulations 🎊 

Regards
Team μcr
