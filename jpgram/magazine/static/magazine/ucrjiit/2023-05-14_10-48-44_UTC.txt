Team Mucr attended the Tech fest organized by #IITKanpur in March 2023.

The entire journey starting from the initial discussions, to building our bots and finally participating in combats and races was a bliss; something we will cherish through out our lives.

We had a blast learning, making mistakes, and bonding with each other while discovering new parts of ourselves.

As I reflect on the experience, I realize it was never about winning.

(We literally bursted 'several' Arduino UNO's, I-6 recievers and what not while making our bots.)
