_"Constitution is not a mere lawyer's document, it is a vehicle of life and it's spirit is always the spirit of age"_- BR Ambedkar.
Today is the day when everyone young or old, tall or short must come together to show the whole world that this nation is the best under the sun. A thousand salutes to great nation of ours. May it become even more prosperous. Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub wishes you a very HAPPY REPUBLIC DAY.
