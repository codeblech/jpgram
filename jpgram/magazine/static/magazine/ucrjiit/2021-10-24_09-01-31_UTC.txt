"Knowledge is wasted if not used, shared and applied!"

Hey first years! Remember the fireworks show you saw, the fairy lights outside our house during diwali which display creative combinations, those robots
You also wanted to make them by yourself right?! Well obviously you won't go to the manufacturing plant….you can make it at home. An Arduino board is all you need and the domain of things you can create is limitless.
Exams are over so the hard part is done, now it's time to dive into the interesting part. The Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub, JIIT is here to help you dive in.
Come be part of our workshop solely devoted to Arduino..how it works, how you work on it to make your projects work, everything!!
