"If a window of opportunity appears, don't pull down the shades."
After a relaxing winter break, Î¼CR announces the Orientation cum interactive session for the field of automata. Here's the chance to get started with one of the major advancing fields of technicality in the world. Robotics is not only about how to make things easier but also about how to make things engrossing and interesting.
Make sure your presence in the orientation. Ideas related to automata are certainly welcomed.
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, somehow they know what you truly want to become.
