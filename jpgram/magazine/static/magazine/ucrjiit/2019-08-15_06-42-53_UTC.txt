It's already seventy three years since we got independence but Indian youths are still subservient. New technology is coming, new thinking is rare. We, the team of Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub,  wish to shape technology in a way that it doesn't come with baneful consequences anymore. 
Î¼CR is doing their best to bring changes.
In memory of many, in honor of all, we wish you all a very happy Independence Day.
