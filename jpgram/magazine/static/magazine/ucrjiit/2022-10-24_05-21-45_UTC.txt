"रिपु रन जीति सुजस सुर गावत।
सीता सहित अनुज प्रभु आवत ॥
सुनत बचन बिसरे सब दूखा।
तृषावंत जिमि पाइ पियूषा ॥" - Ramayana

Diwali is the festival that ushers in the transition from illusion to reality, from darkness to light, and from this world to the next. On this delightful occasion, savour those sweets, light up your dreams, and fill your life with happiness, joy, peace, and health!

Let's burst the false myths and ego
Clean your soul of past bitterness
Light  your lives with acceptance
Celebrate  the sweet bonds
of family and friendship! 

Even one ray of the inner light of the self is beyond all other lights in the universe.Fuse yourself with this motivating and potent light to really appreciate the festival of lights.
