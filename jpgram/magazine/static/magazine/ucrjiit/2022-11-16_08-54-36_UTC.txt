Learning becomes wisdom only after it has been put to practical use. Each one of us is made of experiences. Practical knowledge about a subject is the key to success in many cases.  The Microcontroller and Systems-based Robotics hub of JIIT is here to give this exclusive opportunity with our 𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐒 𝐎𝐍 𝐒𝐄𝐒𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍 in our upcoming event 𝕊𝔸𝔹𝕆𝕋𝔼𝕌ℝ✨

At each step, seniors will be there as the 𝒄𝒓𝒆𝒘𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒔, to help with the slightest difficulty faced by you.Without going through any hassle with the requirements, students will learn how to use essential tools to build their own manual robots and experience the joy of building something useful from scratch.
So, get ready and be a part of our future endeavors to learn, grow and prosper with us!
