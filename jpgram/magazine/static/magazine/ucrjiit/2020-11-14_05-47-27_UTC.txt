With the shining of diyas and the echoes of the chants, may prosperity and happiness of this festival of lights fill our lives just like the colours of rangoli. Hope this Diwali brings new smiles, undiscovered avenues, and different perspective and unbound happiness.
Team Î¼CR wishes you all a happy, safe and blessed Diwali.
Letâ€™s celebrate the festival in the true sense by spreading joy and lighting up the world of others.ðŸŒŸ

Regards!
Team Î¼CR
