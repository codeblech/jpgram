“Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe, engineering is about creating things that never existed."

Engineering is not only the study of 45 subjects but it is the moral study of intellectual life. Engineers' imagination and innovation make them magicians in the true sense. This day marks the 160th birth anniversary of prolific engineer Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya whose contributions to society are an inspiration to people from all walks of life.
We, the entire team of μCR JIIT wishes you all a very Happy Engineer's Day!⚙️✨

Regards!
Team µCR.
