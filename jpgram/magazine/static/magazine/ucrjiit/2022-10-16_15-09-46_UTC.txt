We believe everybody is witnessing that the world is changing, yet again.. and, if you wanna be a part of the game, you'll need to step up too and this time not just watch the paradigm shift but also make the shift play, especially when you are given a chance.

Microcontroller Based  Systems and Robotics Hub, JIIT is here to give you that chance to deep dive into the Robotics by not just experiencing it, but by creating the very core of it, yourself...

Stay Tuned!
