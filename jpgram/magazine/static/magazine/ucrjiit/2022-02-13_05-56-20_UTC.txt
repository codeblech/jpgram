Technophillia'22 calls out all quick-witted problem-solvers out there to participate in "The Mind Flayer", the problem-solving round.

The contestants will have to brainstorm, analyze and solve some stimulating Arduino based problems. The competition also features a debugging round, in which contestants will have to detect and debug and write codes for the given circuits on the Tinkercad platform. Contestants will get assessed on their speed and accuracy.
