“Hard times don’t create heroes, it is during the hard times when the ‘Hero’ within us is revealed”.

The clock is ticking hastily. The longer you wait for something, the more appreciation you will give when it finally arrives. _The wait is almost over_. Brace yourselves, tie your belts as MICROCONTROLLER BASED SYSTEMS AND ROBOTICS HUB is all set to begin their new journey through online event “TECHNOPHILIA 3.0”.
Only one day to go!!

Regards!
Team µCR.
