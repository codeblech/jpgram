“To be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.”

Freedom in mind, Faith in our heart, Memories in our souls.To our freedom fighters, to our soldiers, to our heroes of the nation, they are the reason we are still alive, and we will never forget their sacrifice. 

Celebrating 75 years of Independence. We, the entire team of μCR wishes you all a very Happy Independence Day!🇮🇳

Regards!
Team μCR.
