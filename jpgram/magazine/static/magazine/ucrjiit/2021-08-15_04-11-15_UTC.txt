“Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.”

At the stroke of the midnight hour on the 15th of August 1947, India awoke to freedom of thought, expression, and belief. It is of utmost importance for us now to judiciously utilize this gift of freedom that has been bestowed upon us by our brave freedom fighters and take India to the zenith of peace and prosperity.

With this wish and hope, Microcontroller-based Systems and Robotics hub, JIIT wish you all a very Happy 75th Independence Day.

Regards!
