"The significance of Deepavali is the removal of darkness and ignorance from the mind and filing it with goodness. "

That time of year is here! Celebrations abound. Its Diwali time guys! It is that time of the year when houses are decorated with lights and lamps, new clothes are bought, feasts of delicious savouries are organised. Celebrate this festival of lights with your loved ones with happiness and positivity and joy!
