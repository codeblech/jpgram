As it is rightly said, "𝑺𝒖𝒄𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒔 𝒊𝒔 𝒏𝒐 𝒄𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒄𝒆. 𝑰𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒅 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌, 𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆, 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈, 𝒔𝒕𝒖𝒅𝒚𝒊𝒏𝒈, 𝒔𝒂𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒎𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒂𝒍𝒍, 𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒐𝒓 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐 𝒅𝒐."🙌

It gives us nothing but contentment to see our former coordinator  𝑺𝒉𝒓𝒆𝒚𝒂 𝑺𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒉, to get successfully placed in 𝑻𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒆𝒔 𝑮𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒑 as a 𝑺𝒐𝒇𝒕𝒘𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝑬𝒏𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒆𝒓 𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒏.✨

You have not only been an amazing inspiration but also the leader we look up to. You act as the torch bearer for many students, we hope your coming future is filled with many more adventures and the best of life.✨

Once again a Big Thank You.
Cheers!!!
