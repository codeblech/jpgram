The holy month of Ramadan has come to an end and now it is the time that we all gear up to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr.
May the almighty accept your good deeds, forgive your transgressions and ease the suffering of all people around the globe.
Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub wishes Eid Mubarak to you and your family! 
May this Eid bring happiness to your heart and to your family. Eid ul Fitr Mubarak!
