“The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."
-Mahatma Gandhi

With his principle of nonviolence, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. He always viewed education as an all-round development and not just as literacy. 
We, the team of μCR JIIT, wishes everyone a very Happy Gandhi Jayanti. Let us take inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi to learn from the mistakes of our past and work for a better future.
