2020 was full of mysterious happenings and with lockdown we got a chance to discover our mysterious self. We learnt that life is full of puzzles , which needs to be solved piece by piece and this motivated us to move forward with our  lives finding solution to each mysterious problems we encounter. 

Keeping this unpredictable nature of life in mind , Microcontroller Based Systems and Robotics Hub 🤖 presents to you "mystery maze". If you are a problem solver and love challenges, then this is the right platform to outwit others, a challenging race against the clock where the sole motive is to sometimes either avoid the hindrances, by correcting them, Or just build a new path for yourself. This is the time you prove "it's  always the small pieces that makes the big picture". 🧩
