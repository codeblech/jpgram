Success Is not accidental. It is hard work and learning from failure.

After a tiring T1, tech lovers, it's time for some fun while learning at the same time. Microcontroller based systems and robotics hub is back with its most awaited manual workshop where we gather to have some tech-fun and build our first ever manual bot. So come, explore and learn.
Mark your calendars as a lot is yet to come.
