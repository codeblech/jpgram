Goodbyes are not easy, especially when they are to be said to those who we look up to, draw inspiration from or have a special bond with, and to our seniors who took us under their wing and helped us find our callings, all three apply. We are incredibly blessed to have been under your guidance and leadership, and truly hope that you find success and prosperity at every step of the new journey you are embarking on. Thank you for all the support and goodwill you have shown us over the years. The sweet memories of working with seniors like you  will be hard to forget. 
You all will be missed ❤️
