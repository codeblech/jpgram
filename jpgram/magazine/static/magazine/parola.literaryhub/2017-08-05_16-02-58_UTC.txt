"For good ideas and true innovations, you need human interaction, conflict, argument, debate." - Margaret Heffernan

And our history testified it every time. The greatest leaders of our history had always been the greatest debaters. And leaders are not born, they are made by honing their skills.

The Joust 2017 brings you this opportunity. Come and explore the concealed leader in you. Give him the voice and be the change you want to cherish. The Joust - Literary Festival of JIIT gives you this chance on the 7th and 8th of October 2017.

Don't miss it, let your words be the mightiest. Stay tuned!
