The festival of Raksha Bandhan is an auspicious occasion that marks the presence of the love shared between siblings. This pious bond has helped people come together and spread love across communities uniting the country which  firmly believes in universal brotherhood. 
With the same amount of love, Team Joust wishes everyone a very Happy Raksha Bandhan! May the warmth of this pious bond help you overcome every obstacle.
