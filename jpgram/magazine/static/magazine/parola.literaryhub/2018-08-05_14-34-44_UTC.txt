Never think that war, no matter how necessary or justified, is not a crime.

The agenda for the 'World War Continuous Crisis' Committee is 'Classified'. So, sharpen your arguments and fight the verbal war at The Joust 2018 to combat the adverse effects of the one fought with weapons and blood.

Save the dates as the battlefield of discussion will open up on 22-23 September.
