🎬💬🎤 Calling all performers, drama queens, and wordsmiths! 🎤💬🎬

As we dive headfirst into the most anticipated events of Impression'23, Parola, the literary hub of JIIT presents to you- Words Brawl! 

The event will be conducted as follows:-

Step 1-The contestant will be required to pick up a chit that shall enlist to them the role of a famous personality.

Step 2- The contestant shall pick up another chit that shall enlist to them a topic/situation in which the character assigned to them has to be portrayed.
Henceforth, the contest begins as each individual brings forward the best of their eloquence and sharp-witedness.

Let the gaze of the audience fan the inward fires of oratory in you as you indulge in all the tricks and delusions of this master skill!
