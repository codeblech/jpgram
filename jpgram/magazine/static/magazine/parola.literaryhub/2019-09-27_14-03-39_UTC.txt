It is with immense pleasure that we welcome you all to the fifth edition of The Joust - Annual Literary Festival of JIIT. We give you a platform where the most intellectual minds unite in order to discuss and debate over the most daunting issues of the world. This literary battle is envisaged to witness the most heated conflicts and the most graceful pieces of writing.

We look forward to seeing all the participants on the battlefield which is to be held on 28th and 29th September, ‘Where Words Win Wars.’
