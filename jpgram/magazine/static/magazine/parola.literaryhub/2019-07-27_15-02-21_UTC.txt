"Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech"

Free speech is paramount for any democracy. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
'The Press' allows participants to act as unbiased journalists, reporting on the proceedings of each simulation in the Conference. 
We at The Joust, are here to provide you with a platform to raise your voices against the issue at hand with the committee and to ensure that media truly does remain “The fourth pillar of democracy”

Stay tuned for more updates!
