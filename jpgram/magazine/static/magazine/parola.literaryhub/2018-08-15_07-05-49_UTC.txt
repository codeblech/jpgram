15th August is a day of patriotism, a day to be proud of, a day of our nation. Our independence day is an epitome of the saying, ‘Truth alone Triumphs’. With this spirit in our hearts, the team of Joust wishes one and all a very happy and proud Independence Day. May the flame of patriotism burning in our hearts never go out.
