Reader's Cafe in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, with its massive collection of books, is a paradise for bookworms. You can buy a book or pick one up from their borrowing section, order a coffee and forget a world exists outside the door of this cafe. If you're an avid reader and want to spend some quiet time, this place is for you.

Hence, The Joust 2018 is pleased to announce its collaboration with Reader's Cafe for Slammed!!! - A Poetry Competition.
