Setting yourself up for success is mostly about having the right goal and direction.

We want to congratulate each and every one of you who took part in the OC team recruitment and took a step towards achieving your goals. Each one of you has  something unique within you, and trust us when we say that we had a really tough time selecting the final candidates. 

All of you successfully cleared Round 2 which tested you through home tasks, on the spot challenges and out of the box questions. We are glad to have such skilled people on board!

Congratulations to all those who are finally a part of the OC for JOUST 2022.

We wish you luck for the journey ahead!
