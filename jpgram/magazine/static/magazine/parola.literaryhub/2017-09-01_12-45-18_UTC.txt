"Accurate information is a key part of motivation." CollegeDesk is a students’ media organization that helps students to sail through the information needs that a college goer must be aware of. It provides information about deadlines, date-sheets and important events as well as subject notes and previous year exam papers. It also organizes trips and keeps students updated on various things.

The Joust’17 is proud to be associated with College Desk.
