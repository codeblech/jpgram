Until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream, we invite you to start a dialogue based upon respect for commonly shared values. It is through this dialogue that the world can achieve global visions of sustainable development encompassing observance of human rights, mutual respect and the alleviation of poverty, all of which are at the heart of UNESCOâ€™S mission and activities.
The Joust 2019 is proud to present the agenda for UNESCO-" Improving access to education for refugees and migrants in post-conflict areas." Stay tuned for more updates!
