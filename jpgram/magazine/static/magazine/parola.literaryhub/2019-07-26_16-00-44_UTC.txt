"Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed". UNESCO stands firm with its goals to build peace in the minds of men and women, to ensure equality of opportunities in all aspects, to achieve sustainable development and empower youth to the fullest of their potential. We at The Joust, are here with an opportunity to help you lead the way in framing ground-level solutions to the challenges faced all around the world with a simulation of the “United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.” Stay tuned for more updates!
