Celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and the joy it brings.ðŸª”

The lighting of diyas and fireworks painting the night sky signify the eradication of ignorance and the awakening of inner light. Homes are adorned with vibrant rangolis and colourful decorations to welcome goddess Lakshmi, the harbinger of wealth and prosperity. It is a time of joyous celebration, reflection, and the strengthening of bonds.

PAROLA wishes everyone a joyous and prosperous Diwali filled with laughter and togetherness. May the shimmering lights of Diwali illuminate your life with love, peace, and lots of blessings!
