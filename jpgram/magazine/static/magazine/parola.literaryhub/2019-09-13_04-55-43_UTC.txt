DU Vibes is a media portal headed by the students of University of Delhi.
Its main focus is to develop a platform where all kinds of vital facts relating to college students are exchanged so that nobody misses out an opportunity due to lack of information. It is not just limited to exchange of information but is also a platform for real brainstorming where ideas from all categories are welcomed.

We at The Joust '19, are proud to announce DU Vibes as our Media Partner.

Stay tuned for more updates.
