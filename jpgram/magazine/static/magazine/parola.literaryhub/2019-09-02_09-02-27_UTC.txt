Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other. We at The Joust believe that the executive board brings the right mix of experience and skill to the council they handle and are best equipped to help us meet the standards we have established over the previous years. The Executive Board's primary responsibility is to ensure that the proceedings are as flexible and productive as possible. 
It is with immense pride that we present you the executive board for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
