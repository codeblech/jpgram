"Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all."
- Bhagat singh

15th August - The day our country echoes with patriotic feelings and pride, it's an ode to the sheer bravery showed by our leaders. Itâ€™s not only the celebration of independence, but also of the unity that prevails in a country as diverse as ours.

We at The Joust 2019, celebrate this spirit of freedom and wish you all a very Happy Independence Day.
