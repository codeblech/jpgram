"मेरा धर्म सत्य और अहिंसा पर आधारित है, सत्य मेरा भगवान है, अहिंसा उसे पाने का साधन।" The second of October serves as an opportunity to reflect on the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. We at Parola hope that the principles of non-violence that he stood for remain forever enshrined in the minds of people all over the globe.

On the 147th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we all thank this great saint for securing freedom for our country and stand committed for a peaceful and a non-violent future.
