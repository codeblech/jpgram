Safety doesn't happen by accident and to reincarnate this spirit of safety for women and children in a male-dominated land, we present to you the agenda of All India Political Parties Meet: "Reviewing the Policy for Women and Child Safety in India"
We welcome all the voices that are being raised for the augmentation of the nation.
Buckle yourself up for 22nd and 23rd September. 
Save the dates.
