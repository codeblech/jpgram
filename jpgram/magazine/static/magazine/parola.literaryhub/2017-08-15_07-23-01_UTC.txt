“Our nation is like a tree of which the original trunk is swarajya and the branches are swadeshi and boycott.” — Bal Gandhar Tilak.

Lets take a moment in salutation of the countless sacrifices made by our great freedom fighters. Let us continue to be inspired by their selfless spirit and endeaveour to keep the honor for our motherland above everything else! 
Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.
The Team of The Joust'17 wishes you all a very Happy Independence Day!
