“The clash of ideas is not weakness. Truth reaches its place when tussling with an error.” -  Richard Henry Pratt

The Joust in its 3rd edition this year has proved its mettle for the past two years by inculcating the voice of reason and leaving room for heated arguments to arrive at a conclusion, stimulating the minds and stirring the debater within them. And here it is again, the Literary Festival of JIIT, bigger and better than ever rekindling the lost spirit of Jaypee Youth Parliament.

With a total of seven events this time, the Joust is all set to sweep you along into the world of literature, poetry and deliberation. Stay tuned for the rest of the announcements to know more about the events that’ll be happening.
