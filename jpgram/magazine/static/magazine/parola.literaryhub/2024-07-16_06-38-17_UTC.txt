“Goodbyes aren’t forever. They simply mean ‘until we meet again📝.’”

As the tenure for the session 2023-24 comes to a close, we pass the legacy of our hub to new leaders. It’s a bittersweet moment as we say farewell to our senior advisors, Gautam sir, Vanshaj sir , Parth sir, Prarit sir and Rika ma’am. It all began when you took on the task of reviving our college’s literary fest, The JOUST , after a three-year hiatus . Little did we know, this would lead to the creation of lasting friendships and cherished memories ❤️.

From mentors to friends, from being a helping hand to a shoulder to lean on, you became our safe haven, a beacon of hope when things got tough. You were visionary leaders, inspiring us with your dedication and passion. The time spent with you will be remembered as some of our sweetest college experiences. You encouraged us to challenge our limits, step out of our comfort zones, and grow into confident individuals.

As your college journey ends, we bid you a heartfelt goodbye with deep gratitude . May you shine and inspire wherever you go, achieving everything you desire✨.
