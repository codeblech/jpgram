How wonderful the day becomes when the scorching sun rays blend with the lonely clouds to reveal the wonderful seven colours of the rainbow. How about getting a chance to explore our hidden talents in the rush of our hectic schedules. Don’t you find it parallel?

A good picture always keeps a moment from running away. Let’s change our focus to capture something entertaining. Well here comes the day to invite you young hearts to set your hands on the camera lens and let the flashlight lighten your hidden potential.

We welcome you to Reseau, the photography event of Joust.
