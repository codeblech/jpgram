When it's bigger than any other fest/event that takes place in your college, 
when you have 500+ intellectual participants coming from all over India, when you have your college fully decorated to welcome the guests,
when you have those sleepless nights to continue its legacy, 
when you have those parties to celebrate its success, 
when it's the biggest LITERARY FEST of Delhi NCR.
It is a moment of pride to be part of such a grand event.
