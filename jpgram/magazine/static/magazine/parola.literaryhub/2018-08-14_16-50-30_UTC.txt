Are you afraid of speaking out on a stage?

If so, this is the opportunity to rid yourself of your fear and rise above all. It is time to showcase your verbal skills and raise your voice on social issues at the group discussion being held for all the participants of Joust, from JIIT Sector-62 and Sector-128. 
Be there on Friday, 17th August 2018 at 5PM sharp!
