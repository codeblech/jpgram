“Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.” Sarthak Singh, the president of the debating society of the college for the previous term has always been a firm rock for every literary event that has happened in the college. His ability to plan an event from top to bottom is second to none and his vision has always helped to implement things perfectly.

A quick-witted person who takes responsibilities with utmost enthusiasm, he has created examples for many MUNers and debaters with his significant experience in the circuit. We are glad to have him on-board as the Strategic Advisor of The Joust 2019.
