Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion. It is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. It takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity.

We at The Joust 2017 bring to you all a slam poetry event where you get a chance to incarnate your words and melt them down to passive realities.

Stay tuned as more surprises await you all.
