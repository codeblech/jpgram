The Joust'18 has been a great success. It was really inspiring to see that each person was committed to help us grow upwards. A special thanks to the Chief Guest, Mrs. Jyotika Kalra whose presence enlightened the event. With the combined effort of the entire team, extremely experienced and learned executive boards and most importantly with the presence of such enthusiastic participants, this event turned out to be grand. 
We thank everyone in helping Joust 2018 flourish.
