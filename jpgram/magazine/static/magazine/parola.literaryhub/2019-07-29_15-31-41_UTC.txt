"Every secret of a writer's soul, every experience of his life, every quality of his mind, is written large in his works." Everyone has a story to tell. Some stories are written in books, others are confined to hearts. We pour our hearts out with pens hoping to connect with ourselves, if not others.

We at The Joust 2019, are here with 'Penned' a creative writing competition, to help you showcase the power of your thoughts and imagination.

Stay tuned for more updates!
