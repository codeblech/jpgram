In the sphere of visual storytelling, Tanvi, our Head of Cinematography, shines brilliantly! 🎥✨

“Through the lens of creativity, we capture the essence of life.” This quote perfectly embodies Tanvi’s passion and talent. She trades pixels for memories and brings visions to life with her lens. When she’s not capturing moments, she’s exploring new adventures or dodging adult responsibilities. A problem-solving, idea-generating machine, Tanvi turns dreams into reality with an open heart and an ever-curious mind.

We’re so excited to have her on our team at Parola!
