"The choice is not between the current crisis and blissful isolation. The choice is between the current crisis and an orderly, managed system of mass migration. You can have one or the other. There is no easy middle ground." Migrants are often seen as the perpetrators of disturbances in the society, the government foreseeing them as liabilities and thus restricting their movements across their borders. We at The Joust, are here to provide you with a platform to raise your voices against the silence dangling around the issue at hand with the committee "International organisation for Migration." Stay tuned for more updates!
