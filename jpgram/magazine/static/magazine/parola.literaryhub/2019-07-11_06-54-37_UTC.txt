â€œEvery great achiever is inspired by a great mentor." The first edition of Joust was organised in 2015, and since its inception our esteemed Faculty Co-ordinators, Dr. Santosh Dev and Mrs. Puneet Pannu have been a constant support to the team, encouraging students to live up to their fullest potential.

They are the light which allow us to move into the right direction. We couldn't have asked for better mentors and are truly blessed to have them on our side.
