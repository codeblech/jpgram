â€œMay the sun in his course visit no land more free, more happy, more lovely, than this our country!" â€“ Sardar Bhagat Singh

Today, on Monday, August 15, India celebrates 75 years of freedom from colonial rule after two hundred years of oppression and suppression under the Britishers.
Today we cherish the ones who made our independence possible. Today we celebrate the glory of freedom. Today we pay our respects to our beautiful nation. May this spirit of freedom lead us all to success and glory in life.

Parola wishes everyone a very Happy Independence Day! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
