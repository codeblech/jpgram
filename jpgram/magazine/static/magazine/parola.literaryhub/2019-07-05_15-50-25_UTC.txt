“For good ideas and true innovations, one needs human interaction, thought, conflict, argument and debate.” It all started with an idea. An idea to create a platform for young minds to discuss, debate and deliberate. A platform where all the poets, writers, debaters and journalists could showcase their talent and become a more confident and articulate citizen at the same time.

After establishing itself as the most prestigious literary festival in its preceding editions, The Joust is back with its fifth edition. It is more than just a two-day literary festival, it is a platform to come together and face challenges to solve the most daunting global issues. 
The Verbal Battlefield is ready for conflicts, heated debates and graceful poetries, where the stakes are higher than ever. Are you?

Stay tuned for more updates!
