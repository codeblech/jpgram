Writing is an art of discovering our inner senses and feelings. 
From our childhood, we read and love fictional stories and their characters and many of us have this inner zest of creating our own characters. If this sounds like something you would do, then we present you with a very special event 'InkSpill' - A Creative Fiction Competition of the Joust where you can put your own twist to your favourite tale.

So, be prepared to evoke your inner talent and create something amazing.
