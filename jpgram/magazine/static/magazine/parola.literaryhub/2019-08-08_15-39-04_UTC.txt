The art of Jousting found its crowd in the pages of history. We now look to change the once prevalent skills in combat into a battle by words. We thank you for such a magnanimous response for the event so close to its conception. This does not only represent the quality Joust enshrines but also is a reflection of why it is so popular in the circuit. 
Priority applications are now closed.

The Joust is hosting a literary extravaganza on the 28th and 29th of September. Prepare yourself for the words at war.

Stay tuned for more updates!
