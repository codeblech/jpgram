“Peace on earth will come to stay when we live Christmas every day.”— Helen Steiner Rice

The rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.

Jhankaar Family wishes you a very happy, joyful and prosperous Christmas🎅✨☃️✨
