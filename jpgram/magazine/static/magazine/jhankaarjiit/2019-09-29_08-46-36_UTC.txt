The navratri is one of the most ancient festivals dating back to the times immemorable. Navratri speaks about the great battle that took place between the powerful demon Mahishasura and Goddess Durga. It signifies the victory of good over evil.
Team Jhankaar wishes you a very happy navratri! May you win over every evil that comes in your path to success.
We wish the colour, bliss and beauty of this festival be with you through the year. Also, as the ETHNIC NIGHT is coming soon, keep your clothes on stand by, as it is not too far now.
JAI MATA DI ❤️ #Navratri #Jhankaar #EthnicNight
