"A nation's culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people." - Mahatma Gandhi

Republic Day is a celebration of democracy, unity, and diversity. Beyond the festivities, Republic Day serves as a reminder of citizens' responsibility to uphold the values of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.
