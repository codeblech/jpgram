“Freedom of mind is the real freedom.Aperson whose mind is not free ,though he may not be in chains ,is not a free man.Freedom of mind is the proof of one’s own existence”
-Rightly said by the maker of our Constitution,Mr. B.R Ambedkar. 

With the 74th year of Independence Day, let's celebrate the freedom that the great freedom fighters granted us years ago. Let us cherish our achievements and be grateful for the freedom we enjoy, that was won after a long struggle and many sacrifices. Jhankaar wishes you all a very Happy Independence Day!
