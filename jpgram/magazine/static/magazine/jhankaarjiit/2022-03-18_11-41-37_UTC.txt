Rang, pichkari hai taiyaar, Aao manayein Holi ka pyara tyohaar!

Holi is the festival of colours, love and spring. It signifies the triumph of good over evil. On this beautiful festival of vibrancy and colours, let’s reiterate our commitment to each other by sharing all the different shades of life.

Colours bring so much joy! May the joy always remain in your life!

Jhankar wishes you a Happy and Colourful Holi!
