Bhai Dooj in India marks a celebration of the sibling bond. Sisters pray for their brothers' well-being with a tikka and sweets, and in return, brothers vow to protect their sisters. It's a day that cherishes love and strengthens the sibling connection.

Team Jhankaar wishes you all a happy Bhai Dooj!! May this bond of yours grow stronger with each passing year.
