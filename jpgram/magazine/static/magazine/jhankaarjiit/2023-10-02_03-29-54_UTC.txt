"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."-Mahatma Gandhi. 

This quote by Mahatma Gandhi emphasizes the idea that by selflessly serving and helping others, we can discover our true selves and find meaning and purpose in our lives. 
Let's pay tribute to the Father of the Nation by committing ourselves to truth and non-violence. May the light of Gandhiji's wisdom continue to shine on us and guide us towards a brighter future.

Jhankaar wishes you all a Happy Gandhi Jayanti .
