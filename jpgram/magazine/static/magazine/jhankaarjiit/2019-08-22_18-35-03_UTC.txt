Classical dance is the loftiest, the most moving, the most beautiful of the arts. For it is no mere translation or abstraction of life.
With movements that capture the essence of the music and great technique matched with artistry, we present to you the COORDINATORS of Nrityang- the indian & classical dance society of JIIT.

Congratulations ❤️
