New sessions brings joy, new enthusiasm, a new start. It's all about working in a new way where belief and hardwork is the only key to achieve our targets.

With this we present to you COORDINATOR 2019-20, Mayank Saxena, who believes in togetherness, working together and celebrating together.

Congratulations ❤️
