When you dance , you can enjoy the luxury of being you !
“If you hit a wall, climb over it, crawl under it, or dance on top of it".Dance gives you nothing back, no manuscripts to store away, no paintings to show on walls and maybe hang in museums, no poems to be printed and sold, nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive.”

So here's a chance to be a part of our dance society having three troupes- 
Nrityang, Surkhaab and Music Made Visible
