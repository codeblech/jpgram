Brace yourselves guys and girls, its the much awaited time of the year. Wrap yourself up in traditional attires as colorful as your soul and join the madness at the Ethnic Night'19 on the 12th of October at 5:00pm.

So, come forward and dance your heart out and be lost in the beautiful cultural music we have that will stir each individual's soul and all you'll be left with would be warm memories which you may tend to discuss some day years after over a cup of tea❤️
Seems old school, right?
Stay tuned.
