Agenda of the Meeting: "Will a liberal world be a better world?"

This meeting was not some conventional Right vs Left vs Centre. Rather it revolves around how all these are manifestations of the human response to change in society and how these ideologies in reality are subject to interpretation and have varied definitions. With valuable inputs from Madam President, Senior Advisor of Parola, Strategic Advisor of Parola and most importantly from the freshies and second years, we understand the problem statement with contextual examples of United States of America, India, Nazism and Communist USSR.
