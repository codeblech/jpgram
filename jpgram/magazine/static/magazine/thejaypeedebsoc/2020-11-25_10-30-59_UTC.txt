Dr. Santosh Dev was not only our mentor but a huge part of our support system as well. She was an ideal teacher who was the personification of calmness and wisdom. 
Her passing away leaves a void that can not be filled.
She was one of those rare people who was greatly loved by everyone that met her and will be dearly missed.
