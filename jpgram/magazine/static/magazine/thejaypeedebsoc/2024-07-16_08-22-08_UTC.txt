"In order to be a mentor, and an effective one, one must care. You must care. You don't have to know how many square miles are in Idaho. You don't need to know what is the chemical makeup of chemistry or of blood or water. Know what you know and care about the person, care about what you know and care about the person you're sharing it with."
