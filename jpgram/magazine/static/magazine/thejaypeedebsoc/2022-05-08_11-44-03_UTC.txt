Everything is fair in love and war. Well it’s this love for debating that has led us to this war of words. 
After our extensive teaching sessions, we are here to now showcase our skills for the rest to learn. 
Our enthusiastic participants are taking part in this Hindi Parliamentary Debate competition. A competition which involves two teams, one in “पक्ष” and the other in “विपक्ष” speaking on a topic given on the spot.
