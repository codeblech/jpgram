“Victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting.” - Napoleon Hill

The Jaypee Debsoc presents The Personality of the Week, Joyita Mondal, an inspiration and the symbol of pride and courage.

Joyita Mondal is India’s first transwoman to be on a judicial panel of a civil court. 

She suffered a harsh fate, spent several sleepless nights on an empty stomach. She had to sleep on bus stands and beg on streets, but showed resilience and later became the first trans person from her district to get a voter ID. She also raised awareness and helped trans people and sex workers in getting their fundamental rights and inspired many. She gained respect due to her passion, dedication and nobel work. In 2017, her hardwork paid off when she was appointed as a judge in the Lok Adalat in West Bengal at the age of 29.

Stay tuned and follow our page, where we will pay tribute and honor such inspiring personalities and their journeys every week.
