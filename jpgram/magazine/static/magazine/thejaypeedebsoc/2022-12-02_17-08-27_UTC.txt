We were just in time to introduce our first debating format, The Asian Parliamentary Debate. 
APD format though extensive, is a very thought after debating style, which comprises of 2 bodies, “Government” and “ Opposition” debating head strong. 

During this session, we explained the framework of APD and the various 
speaking roles. 
After this detailed discussion, 
first years were assigned the topic, "This House believes that the Internet should be regulated just like all other media." to deliberate upon. 
To our surprise, both teams presented arguments keeping in mind the complete format, and flow of debate. 
We as a team are in for a great ride, debates like this are only just the beginning!
