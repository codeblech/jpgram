The Jaypee Debsoc presents The Personality of the Week, Councillor Mohinder K Midha.
The dedicated and inspiring Indian-Origin Politician from the UK’s Opposition Labour Party wrote history after becoming the first Dalit woman mayor in the United Kingdom. She has been elected mayor of the Ealing Council in West London. 
A part of the manifesto that she campaigned on for the election stated that if elected she will handle issues like cost of living, post-pandemic recovery, violent crimes and anti-social behavior. Her role includes initiating policy, making decisions and implementing it, being a spokesperson of the council, sharing collective decision making responsibility and developing partnerships in the borough.
