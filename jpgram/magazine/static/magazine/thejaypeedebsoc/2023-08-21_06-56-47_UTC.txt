PART TWELVE: ETHNICITY AND EXTENSION
(END OF CIVILISATION?)

Last Hindu priest refuses to abandon Afghanistan ancestral temple, says 'will consider it Seva even if Taliban kills me.'
Pandit Rajesh Kumar, the last Hindu priest of the Rattan Nath temple, has decided not to leave the country despite being offered help.
Since Afghanistan is no more a safe space for religious minorities, Taliban's capture of Afghanistan is considered as the end of longest civilization which had its roots connected to Hinduism.
