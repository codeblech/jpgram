Agenda : "How does money work and do we really need it?” 

This wasn't some conventional interactive meeting this time at G7. It was way beyond that. Infact it was a simulation of the Banking system of the United States Of America where the room was divided into 4 portions Federal Reserve, Private Bank Morgan Stanley, Private Corporations like Microsoft and General Public to understand the most important concept - Financial literacy which is indeed the need of the hour for youth today. This meet provides the description for monetary and financial functioning of a country and globe. 
What is exactly money, how does it work, who creates it and do we really need it. Why rich gets richer and poor gets poorer? By looking for answers to such questions we are able to understand various economic concepts with more relatable and relevant case studies of United States of America, India and Japan.
