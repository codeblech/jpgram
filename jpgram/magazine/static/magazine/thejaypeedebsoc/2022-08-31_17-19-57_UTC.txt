The Jaypee Debsoc presents the Personality of the Week, Khabane Lame a.k.a Khaby Lame. A person whose silence speaks volumes, became the most followed TikToker in June 2022.
Contrary to the popular 'trying too hard' behaviour that has taken over present day pop culture, his authenticity is quite appealing and debunks or mocks the overproduced trends that happen across social media.
In August 2021, Lame appeared as a co-star for Juventus F.C.'s announcement of Manuel Locatelli. His exasperation is quite universal and emotions are relatable. His skyrocketing to stardom shone an unfavourable spotlight on Italy’s very strict citizenship rules. He represents the idea that hard work and determination gets you far in life. Even though he got layed off during the pandemic cutoffs, he didn't give up and continued making tiktok videos which later became a global sensation. Subsequently he was granted with Italian citizenship in August 2022.
Kudos to him on his hard work, determination and go getting attitude 👏
