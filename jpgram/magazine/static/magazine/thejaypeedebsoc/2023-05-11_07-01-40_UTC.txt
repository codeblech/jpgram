"Goodbyes are not forever, they are just a reminder that we'll miss you until we meet again. Farewell and best wishes to our wonderful seniors."

As you embark on a new journey, leaving behind the familiar halls of this institution, we wanted to take a moment to express our gratitude for everything you've done during your time here. We will miss your infectious enthusiasm, strong opinions, and dedication. 

The Jaypee Debsoc bids Farewell to the members of the year 2022- 2023.
