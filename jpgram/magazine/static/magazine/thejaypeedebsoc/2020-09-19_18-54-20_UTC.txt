A true leader pushes us beyond our limitations, while uplifting our vision. These are just  few of many things our respected seniors inspired us to do, who are true leaders that one can wish for.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank them and say goodbye to the core team of The Jaypee Debsoc for the academic year 2018-19.

We wish them all the best on their journey of success and happiness that awaits them in their bright life!
