Very few nations and times have seen the likes of leaders like the 11th Prime Minster of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji. Born in 1924 in Gwalior, he was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected to Lok Sabha a total of 10 times and also to Rajya Sabha twice. He steered India through the rough coalition years of the Indian democracy and served as the PM not only once, but first for a period of 13 days, then 13 months, finally followed by a full five-year term. 

Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee is known today for the Pokhran II nuclear tests which made India a full-fledged nuclear power and the glorious victory in the Kargil War of 1999. But very few people know that he was also a poet and a scholar. His speech possessed such articulation skills that even opposition leaders couldnâ€™t help but toe their own party lines to support him. He was a true patriot and reformer and dreamt of a shining India, a dream shared by million others. Sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has left an indelible mark on Indian politics, and the ideals that he stood for and the principles he upheld still continue to inspire us.
