The Jaypee Debsoc here presents a blog on the Humanitarian Crisis happening right now in Iran. The controversy began with the death of Mahsa Amini followed by widespread protests in the country. We have here also thrown light on the historical developments with respect to Hijab Row and have drawn significant parallels between the Karnataka Hijab Row and Iran.
