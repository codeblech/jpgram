2020 Theme: Acting together to achieve social and environmental justice for all 

The theme for the Day this year addresses the challenge of achieving social and environmental justice for all. The growing recognition of the multi-dimensionality of poverty means that these two issues are inseparably intertwined, and that social justice cannot be fully realized without aggressively rectifying environmental injustices at the same time. 

We at The Jaypee Debsoc support the initiative #endpoverty and believe that poverty can be eradicated by collective action of everyone.
