Swami Vivekananda, a spiritual genius with a commanding intellect and strength, crammed a lot of work and accomplishment into his brief life . Vivekananda, was enamoured with the agnostic Western schools of philosophy as a young man.

"The greatest sin is to think yourself weak."
He believed that the greatest sin one can commit is to think that they are weak. He believed that we all have the potential to be great and that we should not limit ourselves by thinking that we are not capable of achieving our goals. He encouraged people to believe in their abilities and to strive to achieve greatness.

So Jaypee debsoc wishes the youth to work on themselves and become the beacon of hope to tje masses so that youth can be the change we need in today's time.
