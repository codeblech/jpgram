“As a singer, you have to bring the soul to the song.”

These words were quoted and proved true by one of the few legendary artists that forever changed the course of Indian Music Industry.
Lata Mangeshkar was one of the greatest singers in the nation. She not only created a name for herself in Hindi, but she also recorded songs in over 36 Indian languages.

Before mesmerizing the whole nation with her beautiful voice, the Nightingale of India had to come a long way and face many rejections, with some music directors even remarking her voice as "too thin". They had no idea that this "too thin" voice would cause people to experience feelings they had never experienced before. After her father's death, Lata Mangeshkar was mentored by Ghulam Haider, who believed in her talent and singing. According to Lata, Haider showed complete faith in her talent. She even considered him as her Godfather.

Apart from providing the people with masterpieces in the entertainment media, she brought the nation to tears, including the prime minister after singing the song "Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo" against the backdrop of Sino-Indian War in 1963. In 1974, she became the first Indian to perform at Royal Albert Hall, London. 

She has received numerous honours, including the Padma Bhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Padma Vibhushan, and Bharat Ratna.
Even the Late Dilip Kumar once commented "Lata Mangeshkar ki awaaz kudrat ki takhleek ka ek karishma hain" that translates to "Lata Mangeshkar's voice is a miracle from God". Following all, Dilip Kumar was indeed correct about her, as the entire world mourns the loss of such a magnificent talented soul after her untimely death. May her soul rest in peace.
