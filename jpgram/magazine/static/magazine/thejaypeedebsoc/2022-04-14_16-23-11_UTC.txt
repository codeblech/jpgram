Hello keen learners, DebSoc has been known for being a hub of intellectuals, a place where one can seek knowledge and win debating battles! 

We have been conducting teaching sessions on various agendas this past semester, preparing you to be the most “know it all” in any room you may step in and it’s only time we share this joy on this platform for everyone to witness. 
We invite you all to come to our meetings and share this wonderful experience of learning with us. 

Meeting tomorrow at G7
5pm onwards, 
Be on time.
