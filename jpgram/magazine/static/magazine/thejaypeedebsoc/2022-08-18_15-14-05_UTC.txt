To our freedom fighters, to our soldiers, to our heroes of the nation, they are the reason we are still alive, and we will never forget their sacrifice.

Celebrating the 75th Independence Day, Parola- the litrary hub of JIIT and The Jaypee Debsoc conducted a debate competition. We are pleased to announce the winners for the same. These people through their words moved the whole audience and invoked the idea of patriotism in each and every person, we congratulate you all for this amazing feat!
