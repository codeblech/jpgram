PART NINE: US WITHDRAWAL AND TALIBAN AGAIN
(TALIBAN '2.0' OR TALIBAN '1.0' AGAIN?)

Joe Biden's ascension to Prime minister led to change in Afghan Policy by announcing withdrawal of American Troops by 9/11/21 paving the way for Taliban to recapture Afghan Land and leaving the country in a state of turmoil. Withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan caused the death of so-called democracy and human rights in Afghanistan and potential rise of radical terrorism in the region.
