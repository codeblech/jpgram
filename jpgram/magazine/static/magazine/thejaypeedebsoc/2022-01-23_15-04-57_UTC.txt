The Jaypee Debsoc celebrates Parakram Diwas on his 125th Birth Anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.  He was no ordinary man. The only reason why the British had to leave India, as confessed by British PM Atlee to Justice

PB Chakraborty at the Raj Bhawan in 1956. At that time, Justice Chakraborty, who was then the acting Governor of Bengal, had a prolonged discussion regarding the fundamental factors that had led the British to quit India. We want to quote their conversation here as told by Justice Chakraborty, who had written a letter to the publisher of RC Majumdar's book, A History of Bengal, in which he wrote:

"My direct question to Attlee was that since Gandhi's Quit India Movement had tapered off quite some time ago and in 1947 no such new compelling situation had arisen that would necessitate a hasty British departure, why did they have to leave?

In his reply, Attlee cited several reasons, the main among them being the erosion of loyalty to the British crown among the Indian Army and Navy personnel as a result of the military activities of Netaji.

No words or paragraphs can describe the work and contribution of Netaji Bose in our freedom struggle.
