"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.‚Äù
With a bittersweet feeling in our hearts, on 30th November we bid a warm farewell to our esteemed teacher coordinators of The Jaypee Debsoc, Dr Debjani Sarkar and Dr Ankita Das for their contribution not only to our society but also to the college. It was an amazing evening, hearing the teachers share moving tales and experiences from their journey. On the behalf of the whole Parola and Debsoc team, we appreciate and thank these amazing teachers and wish them luck as they embark on new endeavours. They've been a strong influence on our society and their work ethics inspired us to push ourselves everytime.
