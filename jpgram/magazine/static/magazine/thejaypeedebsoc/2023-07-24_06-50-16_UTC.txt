PART FOUR: SOVIET INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN (1979- 1989)
(COLD WAR, PROXY WAR AND THE MUJAHEDEEN)

Here in this part of the timeline, we have covered about the details of Soviet Afghan War which was a result of Cold war and USSR trying to increase its influence over the Afghan land to access its rich mineral resources. This led to the rise of strong anti- soviet sentiments in the country which were backed up by the USA and subsequently the western block and other Middle East Islamic nations converting the whole region into a site of proxy war. And finally, we have covered how Jihad emerged against Soviet in the form of Mujahedeen warlords.
