In the past weeks, The Jaypee Debsoc have had incredible session with first years. It first started with a lively introduction during which everyone of our new members came forward and introduced themselves. They were interrogated by the seniors with much intriguing questions. 
 
The introduction was followed by our first Group Discussion (GD) on the subject of "Would India become the biggest economy in the next debate in terms of GDP?" All of them present astounding fascinating perspectives and ideas that would cause anyone to consider. 
We are proud to say, we have such intellectual and keen learners in the society. 
With such members, The Jaypee Debsoc would reach even greater heights!
