Agenda: Hustle between Morals and Ethics in different scenarios

Morals are what we act as an individual or human, whereas acts of ethics are defined by the profession of an individual. We as humans often come across various scenarios where we have to make tough decisions between our morals and our ethics. Even though we all were in fest mode, the debating attitude of curiosity and speaking was as high as expected from the debating. Even though it was a Fun activity, we all had a very active, enthusiastic and healthy discussions on the certain scenarios and the outcomes of this activity were:
We became more empathetic toward people belonging to different professions and situations.
We improvise on our critical thinking and expanding the horizon of debating.
We interact with each other with more logical assertions followed by justifications and examples as well.
