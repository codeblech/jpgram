We are thrilled to introduce our Vice President, Priyanshu Baswala, a wanna be human, who is looking for strategic insight, and has lost all unwavering enthusiasm.

Serving as our mentor for the 2023-24 tenure, Priyanshu brings vibrant energy to the Debating Society, inspiring us all to achieve exceptional feats. His expertise in conducting Asian Parliamentary Debate (APD) mocks has sharpened our skills and prepared us for competitive excellence. 

Priyanshu's knack for teaching philosophy in an engaging and comprehensible manner has forced us to learn oursleves which then broadened our intellectual horizons and deepened our understanding of complex concepts.

His penchant for posing intriguing questions constantly challenges us to think.

Priyanshu's unique perspective in debates, driven by his critical thinking and curiosity, has taught us to think outside the box. From coaching us in debates to helping with time management and coding he has been a role model for many. 

The "winner gets the Dairy Milk" contests and unique debates he has organized have ignited our passion for debating.

Join us on this exciting journey where we will eat icecream and learn.
