A reformer, a scholar and a true stalwart of Indian Independence, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri has left a legacy that is hard to top. Born in a humble family on October 2, 1904, he was a man of principles and always righteous in his cause. Due to his dedication to the nation, he quickly rose to high positions of power and held various ministries before finally becoming the second Prime Minister of India in 1964.
Shastri’s thoughts were greatly inspired by Swami Vivekananda and he was a staunch patriot who knew the soul of India inside-out. _“Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”_, the slogan he gave very accurately sums up his legacy. He promoted the green revolution, the white revolution and guided India to a proud victory in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965.
