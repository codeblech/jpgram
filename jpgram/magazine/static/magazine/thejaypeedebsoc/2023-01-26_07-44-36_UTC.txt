The Jaypee DebSoc honors the adoption of the Constitution of India and the creation of the world's largest democracy. As we celebrate Republic Day, let us take a moment to reflect on the richness and diversity of our culture, the strength of our democracy, and the resilience of our people. May this day be a reminder of our shared values and the power of unity. Let's pledge to work towards building a more inclusive and progressive India.
Happy Republic DayðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
