PART 3: AFGHAN- SOVIET RELATIONS (INTERSECTION OF ISLAM AND COMMUNISM)

Here we have thrown light on how the Afghan Soviet relations grew post the Third Anglo Afghan War which resulted in socialist reforms in the country and participation of women in the public domain. These reforms were not really appreciated by the Islamic fundamentalists and especially in the eastern and south- eastern parts of the country.
