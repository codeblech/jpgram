Representation comes through varied sources and medium. June may come to an end, but Pride is forever and it's time to make our bookshelf and OTT watchlist to be more inclusive and inclined to the actual social reality. The Jaypee Debsoc has tried to come up with some different recommendations in Queer media- literature, Cinema and OTT which are actually free from all the queerbating and pinkwashing agendas as portrayed in Teen dramas, Spanish shows, Mexican Shows and other English shows. Again this list is inexhaustible and we would love to have more recommendations mentioned in the comment section.
