Great leaders always make a difference.
Our seniors have been the catalyst for The Jaypee Debsocâ€™s success and it is our privilege to be able to celebrate them! We appreciate all that they have done for us and sincerely hope to live up to the standards set by these trailblazers. 
The Jaypee Debsoc presents 'A Trip down Memory Lane' where our seniors will share their invaluable experiences with us.
We thank Shreya Kadyan ma'am for sharing her wise words with us and guiding us to a better future!
