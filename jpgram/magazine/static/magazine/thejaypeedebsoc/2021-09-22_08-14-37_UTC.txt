_“Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.”_
2020-21 proved to be a session of great success and overwhelming achievements for the Jaypee DebSoc with total participations crossing one hundred. The members of the society proved their mettle in all kinds of debating formats and oratory events. 

The teams sent by the society qualified for various rounds in several prestigious inter-college Asian Parliamentary Debates and Hindi Parliamentary Debates and won several awards in Model United Nations, Conventional Debates, Extempore and Just-A-Minute events. The Jaypee DebSoc has now begun its journey in the new session with renewed hopes and aspirations with one single aim of dwarfing the successes of the previous year.
