Much of what we have built these past years directly results from their leadership, vision, commitment and hard work. Therefore we want to take this opportunity to thank them and say goodbye to the core team of The Jaypee Debsoc for the academic year 2019-20.
As they enter a new phase of  life, we wish them loads of success, with a cup full of happiness, mountains of achievements and good wishes to live your dream every moment!✨
