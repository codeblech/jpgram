"Thou shall not commit logical fallacies" 
- words lived by these true leaders. A lesson that will forever remain with us. 

Letâ€™s take an opportunity to express our gratitude to these mentors for their commitment towards the society. Thank you for your guidance and hard work. 

We would like to say goodbye to the core team of The Jaypee Debsoc for the year 2020-2021 and wish them lots of success for their future endeavours. 
Cheerio!
