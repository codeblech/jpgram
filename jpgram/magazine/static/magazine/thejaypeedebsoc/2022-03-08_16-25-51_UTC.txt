We present you with 
“The Debsoc t-shirt for women empowerment”, as our symbol of change! 
The idea is to stop asking women to "stay safe" and seek a safe environment for themselves and take the burden of what should have already been theirs but rather, make them "feel safe" in our environment.
Our members are required to wear this t-shirt in our official meetings and volunteer work to spread this message all across the red bricks of Jaypee. 

Debsoc members are ready to embody their debating spirits and uniformly celebrate this journey of empowerment.
