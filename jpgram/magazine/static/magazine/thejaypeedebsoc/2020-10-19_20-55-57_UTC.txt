India celebrates National Solidarity Day on 20th October every year.

It was the day when our northern neighbour who was a friend to us, propelled a sudden  attack on our territory which continued for about a month ending in November,1962 .

The purpose of the day is to celebrate the memory of solidarity, unity, and integrity of our people during the war in order to protect the nation. Therefore, the recognition of National Solidarity Day is a yearly token of the central solidarity and greeting of love, gratitude, and respect for our Armed Forces. Also, the entire country recalls those soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the nation.
