After 3 days of long and rigorous audition sessions, we present our final list of candidates selected for The Jaypee DebSoc for the year 2021-22.

Interacting with all the applicants over the past few days has been an incredible experience, and the unique and diverse responses we received made narrowing down from 428 registrations a humungous task. We hope that we can continue to make DebSoc an inclusive space for everyone to learn and grow. Irrespective of today's decision, we believe that each individual we have interacted with has tremendous potential to grow, and we will be happy to be a part of that journey with you.

For all those who have been selected, welcome to the family. We look forward to many more interesting discussions with you. We will be communicating details pertaining to the induction shortly!

Congratulations to everyone who cleared the auditions, hoping for a good year of debating ðŸŽ‰
