Greetings! We are glad to announce the winners of "Online Speech Competition".

The Jaypee DebSoc extends its heartfelt congratulations to the winners who have made it directly into the second round of auditions and emerged as triumphants inspite of the cutthroat competition. 
While the rest still have a reason to be happy as we are having the first round of the auditions on 1st October.
Wishing you luck for the upcoming roundsðŸŒŸ

Regards, 
The Jaypee DebSoc
