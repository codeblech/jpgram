After giving due regards to our old logo now the time has come to revamp the logo of The Jaypee DebSoc.

Jaypee DebSoc has been a beacon of change and learning and keeping that in consideration we’ve changed the pedestal of our old logo which depicted a “goal-orientated” approach to a staircase that encapsulates our “path-oriented” approach. Along with this change, the logo has a sense of freshness to it, which represents the kind of ideas the new generation of DebSoc members has.

Kindly enjoy the new logo of our society.

Regards,
The Jaypee Debsoc.
