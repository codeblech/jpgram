“Leadership is an action, not a position.”
The Jaypee DebSoc is proud to announce the President and Vice-President for the session 2021-22. 

President – Praseem Pramod Jaiswal
Vice-President – Divyansh Chauhan

Both of them have guided many students through the world of debating during their tenure as secretaries of the society during the session 2020-21. We wish them all the success for the new session under these new positions.
