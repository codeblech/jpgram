The next destination on our map is a poem pressed into the service of a city. It is none other than Rome.

History can be seen here in the stones of the street and the rays of sunshine. Wander here and feel the echoes, illusions and yearnings of the history. Throw a coin in the famous Trevi Fountain and make a wish, and stay tuned as we make ‘your’ globetrotting dreams come true.
