If you want to board the Impressions Express, there's no way you can miss the first coach to ‘Discover the Voyage’ and get a glimpse of the various events that’ll be conducted at Impressions. 
We've often heard that the journey is more beautiful than the destination. JIIT Youth Club, along with 28 extraordinary hubs of the college, is here to challenge this notion by making the destination more miraculous and sensational than the journey leading to two days of spectacle!

Mark your presence as each hub gives you an insight into the opportunities to stretch your wings and soar high into the sky of IMPRESSION'19. 
See you all at 5 PM in LT 3 on 5th February i.e. Tuesday.
