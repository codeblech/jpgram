The glory of the tri colour raised high into the air as the parade of soldiers marches on, commemorate the day our constitution came into effect 69 years ago. Today, we celebrate Republic Day with our pride and honour as an Indian. 
We wish you a happy Republic Day as we hope that this feeling of patriotism continues to stir our hearts forever.
