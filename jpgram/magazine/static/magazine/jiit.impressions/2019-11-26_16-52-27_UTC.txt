"No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it." A strong team is the foundation of any endeavour. With constant hard work, perseverance and resilience, the team of JIIT Youth Club is the force behind putting up the biggest events in the college. Shedding their sweat and blood throughout the year, it is the raging fire within these individuals that helps them create magic with Ebullience, Ethnic Night and the masterpiece, the flagship event of JYC, Impressions. 
We proudly present to you the team of JIIT Youth Club for the year 2019- 2020.
