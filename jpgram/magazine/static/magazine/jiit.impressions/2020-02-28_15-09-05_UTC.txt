Aren't Kathi rolls the best thing to have happened to the grab and go generation of ours? Easy-to-eat, loaded and ever-so-delightful, these rolls are the perfect pick for those who are in a rush or are simply lazy.
And Chowringhee located on Jaipuria Sunrise Plaza, Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, is Picasso when it comes to rolls and Chinese.

We are proud to announce Chowringhee as our official Food Partner for Impressions'20.
