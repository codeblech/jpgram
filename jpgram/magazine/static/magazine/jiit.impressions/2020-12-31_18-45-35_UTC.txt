Tale of 2020: First time in history, we got a year-long Sunday, our childhood fantasy, but this backfired us very harshly. The only weekend plan we were left with this year was turning in assignments and a lot of projects. This year made us realise that even small moments with our friends, the family carries the real essence of happiness. Get ready to start afresh from Page 1 of 2021 carrying all the wisdom earned in the previous year.
Team Impressions wish you all a very Happy New Year 2021!
