We truly believe that anyone who says that money cannot buy happiness has never spent their money on pizza. And if Pizza is art, La Monza Pizzeria is an artist, located in Indirapuram. Known for its minimalist yet focused approach on the right amount of sauce and a crispy flavourful crust, you can be sure that La Monza Pizzeria takes its pizzas very seriously. 
We are proud to announce La Monza Pizzeria as our Food Partner for Impressions'20.
