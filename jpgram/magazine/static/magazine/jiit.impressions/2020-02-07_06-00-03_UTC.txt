Alive: living, not dead
/əˈlaɪv/

We know it is hard to survive exams, attendance and projects. It is tough to keep your inner child alive, to keep up the excitement amidst the mundane routine. To get over this boredom and have a memorable time, we bring to you an event like you've never witnessed before! 
We are proud to present to you a two day carnival of magic to make you feel alive at Impressions'20.
