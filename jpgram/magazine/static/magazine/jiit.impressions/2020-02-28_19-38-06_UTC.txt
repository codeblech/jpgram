Magic in the air.
Fire in our souls. 
The stage has been set up. After months of hard work and persistence, we have given Impressions all we had to put up the grandest show for you. We hope you have the time of your life and make memories to cherish for a lifetime. We just can't wait to see you all tomorrow! 
Love,
Team Impressions'20.
