“A leader is the one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.”
Apoorv Singhal, Darpan Jain and Jayesh Majumdar, the names synonymous to management and leadership in college, have been JIIT Youth Club’s pillars of strength for the past two years. Having been at the forefront of almost all the flagship events in college, these names have set a new benchmark in terms of management. Their ‘never-say-die’ attitude has proved to be an indispensable asset to the team at the most crucial times. 
We are proud to present to you the Executive Board, JIIT Youth Club 2019-20.
