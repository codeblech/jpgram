After a splendid display of roads untravelled, woods unexplored and beaches untouched, we finally bring to you the snaps that plucked the adventure string of our hearts. The scenic pictures which made our hearts long to book our tickets for a vacation are:
1st place: Aryan Kochhar
2nd place: Sanket Chauhan
3rd place: Snehima Gupta
Editor's choice: Himanshu Swami and Rishab Nema

Thank you everybody for making 'Capture Your Adventure' in association with A Sailor a ravishing exhibition of dauntless ventures and harmonious moments.
