If only we could relive and absorb the happiness of all the beautiful memories in slow motion. 
Impressions'19 gave every student a golden opportunity to stand out and put their creativity at display with the Slow Mo challenge. After receiving an over whelming response and having our DM flooded with entries, we are glad to announce the one entry which made all our jaws drop.

We whole heartedly congratulate the winners of Slow Mo Challenge.
