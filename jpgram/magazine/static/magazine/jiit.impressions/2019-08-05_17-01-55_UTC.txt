Dr. Pankaj Kumar Yadav, the Faculty Coordinator of JIIT Youth Club, has always been the best mentor and a source of inspiration for all of us. 
Standing tall beside the team through all the ups and downs, he has never backed down from encouraging openness, honesty and commitment by being the glue that binds the team together. A visionary, Dr. Yadav has time and again proved that nothing is impossible if one has the will to do it. His intellect, vision and matchless efforts have been instrumental in JIIT Youth Clubâ€™s success. 
We are truly blessed to have him as our mentor!
