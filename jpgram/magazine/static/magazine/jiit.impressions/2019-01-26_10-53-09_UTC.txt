Strength in our mind, Pride in our soul, Gratitude in our hearts. Happy Republic Day to all!

Never forget the supreme sacrifices of soldiers who died for the welfare of the nation. May we always choose freedom and to live peacefully over everything and may we always make our country proud.

We wish you all a Happy Republic Day. Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
