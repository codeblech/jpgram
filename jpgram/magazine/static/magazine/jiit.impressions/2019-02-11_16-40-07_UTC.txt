Subway has been challenging the notion of 'healthy food never being tasty' for years now. With the tagline of 'Eat Fresh', Subway is the epitome of nutritious yet finger licking sandwiches, salads and many more healthy options. With their wide variety of breads baked to perfection, it gives the customer the right to choose everything, right from patty and toppings to sauces to make that perfect Sub!
