The feeling of
Leaving an extraneous Impression 
On an otherwise ignorant universe 
Has now been 
Etched and engraved 
And it reverbs around us
Clouded with unforgettable memories. 
Impressions is indebted 
To all the exuberance 
By all artists and creators 
This madness, this insanity 
Will one day 
Change the world. 
#Antiquity 
We'll be back soon.
