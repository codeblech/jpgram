Merging all the light of the world still fades as compared to a ray of the inner light of the self. This festival of light blend yourself in this light and let the gleam of diyas enlighten your soul and vanquish darkness from your life.Â 
Light a lamp of love, burst all your sorrows and anxiety and shoot a rocket of your success, prosperity and good luck!

JIIT Impressions wishes all of you a Happy and safe DiwaliðŸª”
