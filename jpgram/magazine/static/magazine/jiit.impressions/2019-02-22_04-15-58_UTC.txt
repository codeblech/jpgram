Impressions is a haven for those who love to dance and who love to eat. This time though, we also have a surprise for those who love to get their laughing bones tickled.

We present to you a stand up comedian who hails from the same background as all of us- Engineering and the winner of Comicstaan Season 1 - Nishant Suri. Born and brought up in Delhi, he loves to make people laugh with his one liners and creative jokes and is sure to take the fun quotient of Impressions up by a notch.

So prepare to laugh your heart out on 23rd February!
