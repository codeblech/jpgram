"An artist has no home in Europe, except in Paris." -Friedrich Nietzsche

Artists are born at different places of the world but art resides here. One of the most beautiful pieces of art in this world is the Eiffel Tower. Being the most-visited paid monument in the world, it is the top notch attraction of the heavenly city Paris. Nothing is more fantastic, tragic and sublime than this paradise.
If you don't believe in love, then visit this place to feel the beauty and love of this city.
