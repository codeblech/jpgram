Chai's magic is something that is hard to describe in words yet Chai O’clock has managed to capture its essence. Located in sector-75 Noida, it offers a wide variety of cold and hot brews to choose from and of course has delicious side much-ons ranging from maggie and samosas to fudge and cakes. Chai O’Clock is the best hangout spot for all the chai-fanatics for a quick and affordable chai-infused nirvana.
