Celebrated on the darkest of nights, Diwali, the festival of lights, is symbolic of the luminosity of knowledge and happiness in the darkness of life. 
May Goddess Laxmi bless you and your family with health, wealth and wisdom on this auspicious occasion. 
This Diwali, let's strive to lighten up the lives of people with Diyas of kindness and generosity. ||शुभ दीपावली||
