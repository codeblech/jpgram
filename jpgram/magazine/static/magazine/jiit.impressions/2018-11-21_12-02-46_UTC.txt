#3 A Lone Traveller

In the summers of 2017
I had to detox
I needed time to cleanse my mind
Hence, I made this trip
A trip to Chandratal Lake
Being a solo traveller in a group is quite fun
You kinda get to have the best of both worlds
Some said I was lonely
Some said I was mad
Well, I felt like being to myself
We went nearby ,to the lake
Where my fellow group members took a halt
Determined for some adventure and peace
I started trekking around the lake all by myself
Reaching nearby to the end of the lake
I saw no signs of life
Within 5 km of radius
My heartbeat was the only thing to be heard
I didn't feel scared,
I don't know why.
Nor did the Idea of being attacked stopped me
I felt at peace-
I was in love with the beauty.
I wanted to stay there for long
But then remembered I had a group to be with
I started marching back
With clouds moving faster than me
Making the lake sing
I listended to it's music
While I reached back
It was a beautiful moment
One of the most unique experiences of my life
As I had no one to share it with
But I didn't had to-
As the moment was truly mine. - Rishab Nema
