"Sometimes things don't go as planned ... and you can still have a great experience"

-Evie Burke
This year sadly, due to some unavoidable reasons we will not be able to host Mustafa Zahid with the Roxen Band.
We planned an unbelievable night for you but not always do things go as we plan and yet being the engineering students we are we always come back with a bang. And at Impressions, well we never just give up so get excited because we have surprises lined up for you.
The wait has begun,stay tuned!
