“All the world’s a stage, and all men and women merely players.” 

Following this Shakespearean quote The Thespian Circle takes us on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, switching from soft funny mimicry to harsh realities of life through the plays and acts that are performed at Impressions. They not only take us in a completely different world but also challenge our thought process through their splendid acting and original storyline.
