Entertainment: amusement, diverting or engaging
/ɛntəˈteɪnm(ə)nt/

The art of entertaining the audience to the fullest is definitely a hard shell to crack. But Impressions has managed to amuse JIITians year after year and this year we promise you to provide a weekend where you will forget to watch your phones. A weekend which will compel you to leave the room and make memories. So if you don't have a happening month- end plan yet, fret not because we have your back!
