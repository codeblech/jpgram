Oh deer! It's the baking, wrapping, present buying, elf-on-the-shelfing time of year! 
The celebration of the event that set heaven to singing, an event that gave the stars of the night sky a new brilliance.

Impressions'19 wishes you a very Merry Christmas! May your Christmas be filled with the true miracles and meaning of this beautiful time.
