Friends: People bonded by affection
/fr…õnds/ 
The best friendships are those formed by the highs and the lows gone through together. So use the happiest two days of the year to escape the monotony of every day routine and reignite the flames of friendship because Impressions is best enjoyed with the people you love and hold close to your heart.
