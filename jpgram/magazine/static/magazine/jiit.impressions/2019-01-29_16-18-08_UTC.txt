After several months of hard work and dedication it’s time to create a new quest with Impressions’19. 
We have built our new website with your convenience in mind, allowing you to easily access fest-related information you are looking for. We are overwhelmed to officially announce that our website, made by @saranshbarua, is now live! 
Lose yourself in the world of Impressions. 
We invite you to visit our website, the link for which you’ll find in our bio.
