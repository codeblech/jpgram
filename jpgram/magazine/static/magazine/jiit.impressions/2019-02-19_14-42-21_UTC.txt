This world consists of two types of people. The people who 'eat to live' and the people who 'live to eat'. For the latter category, we bring a new found adda and the coolest place for 'Gup-Shup' over chatpata finger-licking food. 
We, being the foodies that we are, cannot miss even one opportunity to hog till our stomachs explode and for that, 'Bhukkads at Nukkad' is the perfect spot. With a pocket friendly menu, it ensures that students do not have to compromise on quality food due to budget constraints.

We are proud to announce ‘Bhukkads at Nukkad’ as our Food Partner.
