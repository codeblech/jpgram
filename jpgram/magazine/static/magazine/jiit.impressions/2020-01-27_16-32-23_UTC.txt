Heroes come and go but legends are forever.

Legacy is all about remembering the idea along with the man behind it because a man can be killed and forgotten but an idea holds the power to change the world even after centuries. Not only was Kobe an exceptionally talented basketball player but also an inspiration to millions.
Here's to a man who will continue to reign our hearts for time immemorial. Here's to celebrating a life large enough to never be forgotten.

Rest in paradise Mamba.
