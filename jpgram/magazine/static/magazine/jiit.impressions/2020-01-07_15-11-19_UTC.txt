From the thrilling Tom & Jerry chases to Nobita’s daily misadventures. We’ve all spent countless lazy afternoons glued in-front of the magical box that we call a Television, cut off from reality, just us and our imagination on a journey of a lifetime. 
Impressions'20 invites you to take this opportunity to 'Rewind' and share the story of how a television or comic character inspired you in your childhood and continues to motivate you to cope up with the struggles of adulting. 
Please keep the following in mind while sending the entries: 
1. Send us your entry (upto 100 words) at jiityc@gmail.com to win exciting prizes. 
2. Entries will be judged on the basis of the content as well as the likes, shares and comments. 
3. Facebook page of Impressions must be liked and the Instagram account must be followed. 
4. Only the first 15 entries will be selected for the competition. So, hurry up!
