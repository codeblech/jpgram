"You can leave Hong Kong,
but it will never leave you." -Nury Vittachi

Once a year go someplace, you have never been before. Hong Kong is the place where you can transcend culture and culinary borders.

A lot of stories out there are waiting for you to live them, so come and create your own story here while hiking the trails.
