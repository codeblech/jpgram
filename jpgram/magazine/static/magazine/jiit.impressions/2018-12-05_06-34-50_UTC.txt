Imagine browsing through a menu and coming across food items with absolutely unique names, something like that is sure to spark your curiosity in a bid to try something new out.

In our ‘Name It Win It’ competition in association with The Sandwich Station, people used their creativity to come up with amazing names for popular food items. The winners who came up with the best ideas are:

Krishn Agarwal - The Bermuda Triangle 
Aman Suri - Feast for a Beast
Meenal Gupta - Magneto Punch
Dini Jain - Rock n Roll

We thank you guys for the great response.
