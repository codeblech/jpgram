"The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past" is what our technical team believes at GDSC and we all are committed to working towards that future of the Web. GDSC feels elated to present to you the technical team members of the year 2021-22. Though every one of our team members is a proud geek these are the few that make us shine.
