This past year at GDSC JIIT has been nothing short of phenomenal! 🥳

Our journey began with a bang 💥 – the Internal Hackathon for SIH '23 in September! With a record-breaking 700+ registrations, this hackathon marked a new chapter in GDSC JIIT history. 🏆 With a goal of continued learning, we hosted the Cloud Study Jams 👾 in October, where our dedication earned us the prestigious Bronze Tier achievement. December saw the Android Development Camp take center stage, conducted entirely online with numerous enthusiastic participants joining both days. ‍ 

Then came the much-awaited Impressions 2024 in February, a whirlwind of exciting events. With Codecharades 🎭 on Day 1 and Chords & Clues 🎶 on Day 2, we saw a combined participation of over 180 JIITians eager to test their skills on our carefully crafted challenges. 

March and April witnessed our flagship event: Aspire 🚀. The Aspire Info Session was held in person in March with a remarkable turnout. We delved into exciting fields like blockchain, AI/ML, data science, and web development, and even launched the GoogleVerse segment! The momentum continued with the Aspire Hands-on Workshops in April, focusing on Data Science/ML and Web Dev. With over 100 participants attending in person, these workshops empowered students to gain practical experience. ‍👩🏻‍💻 

As we wrapped up the year in May, we proudly facilitated the Gen AI Study Jams, achieving the coveted Gold Tier 🥇. This accomplishment reflects our unwavering commitment to fostering a vibrant learning environment in our campus. 

The 2023-24 tenure for GDSC set numerous landmarks and brought forth new ideas — whether that be GoogleVerse in Aspire, the twist of bhailang in Codecharades, the use of Gemini in Chords & Clues, or the reels we launched in promotion of our events. We can't wait to see what the next year brings for GDSC! 🥳🚀
