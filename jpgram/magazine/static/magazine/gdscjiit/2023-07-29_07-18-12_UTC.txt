The 2022-23 term for GDSC JIIT was an exhilarating journey filled with innovation, teamwork, and growth!🎉 

Having started with the Compose Camp in October, we successfully organized Hackin' Winters ❄️ with over 100 participants in November along with advanced workshops on various technical themes. We held the reputed ASPIRE program in the same month, which gathered hundreds of curious minds to kick off their journey in tech. The next semester was equally productive for the club. We conducted the Web Portfolio building in HTML & CSS for aspiring students in February and the Flutter Forward Extended program where we guided students in Flutter and Firebase in March. Along with that, we campaigned for the famous Google Cloud Career Practitioner program that got numerous students official Google swags 🤩.

Then came Impressions 2023 👾. While all of the core team at GDSC was excited to get their annual fest back, we knew we had a great opportunity to organize fun and innovative events for the students. Despite simultaneous non-technical events, CSS Smackdown and Bake A Cake were two of our most fascinating events that invited hundreds of participants to try their hands at web development and cryptography.

As we wrap up this term, here is a massive shoutout to our core team for making every event and campaign an unforgettable success! 🌟
Our hearts brim with excitement and curiosity as we kick off the new term! Stay tuned for even more fun and innovation!🚀🎉
