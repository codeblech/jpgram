Attention!!

We want to remind you of the college's email notice: Starting on September 5th, our college G Suite IDs can only store up to 5 gigabytes (5GB) of data.

We kindly ask every club to please download your event photos before the 5th. After that date, we won't be able to assist with any lost photos.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
